to transform the AF Technical Order (TO) environment to provide the warfighter with user friendly, technically accurate, and up-to-date digital technical data at the point of use that is acquired, sustained, distributed and available in digital format for all technical data users; and to support moving the AF TO management enterprise towards the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS). <br />\\r\\nThe 754th ELSG/ILMT, Technical Data Section, requires functional and technical expertise for the following Technical Data Systems: ATOS, eTOV, ETIMS, JCALS, JEDMICS, and TMSS</p>\\r\\n<p>754 ELSG/ILMT is the responsible Program Management Office (PMO) for the development and sustainment of the aforementioned systems. These SME services are essential in order to maintain the functionality of the systems listed below:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>ATOS is a stand alone, loose-leaf publication and document management system for Air Force TO changes. ATOS, in accordance with continuous acquisition and life-cycle support (CALS) requirements, receives stores and maintains digital tech order page change data and produces postscripts to TO pages. There are AF-operated ATOS production systems at three Air Logistics Centers (ALCs). ATOS currently supports import/export of digital data automating publishing processes for text, General Markup Language (GML), Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Indexed Portable Document Format (IPDF), and graphics (raster, vector, and computer graphics metafile) data creation; capture of loose-leaf changes; storage of digitized TO data; and acceptance of digitized TO data directly from Department of Defense (DoD) industry sources. ATOS software is a mixture of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Contractor developed software. ATOS consists of seven subsystems: production control, text capture, text generation, graphics capture, graphics generation, review and output. ATOS is the official Air Force organic system for TO production, management, storage, and maintenance. ATOS is designated as a Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III computer resource (i.e., system is necessary to conduct day-to-day business) for the AF </li>\\r\\n    <li>The eTOV encompasses five principal functions: transformation, eTO viewing, eTool (mobile workstation) management, distribution, and repository. Transformation is provided with a COTS product from Command Technology, Inc (CTI). The eTO Viewing is provided by both an on-line version and a disconnected or local version. The on-line version is viewed via the AF Portal in a connected mode. The disconnected or local version is viewed via an eTool based capability with TOs stored locally to support viewing while disconnected from the network. The on-line viewer software provides basic repository capabilities. Custom eTOV modules (message management, eTool management, and distribution software for master and slave eTools) were developed for the government. These eTOV modules support data exchanges with ETIMS and delivery of eTOs to designated eTools based upon the ETIMS defined and managed subscriptions. To support the transformation and initial review process, a custom developed verifier tool, provided by NCI Information Systems, Inc., supplies comparison of Portable Document Format (PDF) to Command Publishing Suite (CPS)-transformed HyperText Markup Language (HTML) eTOs. The custom developed verifier tool was developed to support comparison of eTO data with different formats. eTOV is designated as a MAC II computer resource (i.e., system is important to the support of deployed and contingency forces) for the AF </li>\\r\\n    <li>ETIMS provides a Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) hosted capability for AF system maintainers to manage their TO and Electronic Technical Order (eTO) subscriptions and libraries. ETIMS is integrated and interfaces with the Electronic Technical Order Viewer (eTOV), Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS), and Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) systems. The purpose of ETIMS is to provide a combination of services and interim capabilities to support TO management and use until ECSS is able to provide these services and capabilities and subsumes ETIMS. ETIMS is designated as a MAC II computer resource (i.e., system is important to the support of deployed and contingency forces) for the AF </li>\\r\\n    <li>JCALS is the Air Force &ldquo;System of Record&rdquo; for TO management. JCALS is a Mission Assurance Category, MAC II, Joint-Service (Air Force, Army, Navy) integrated enterprise computing project supporting the DoD Integrated Data Environment (IDE) and paperless process mandated by the Congress of the United States and downward directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). JCALS transitioned TO management from paper media to a paperless, electronic, automated digital environment. It improves business processes for TO functions, such as acquisition, recommended changes, publishing, stock management and distribution. JCALS supports the warfighter by providing up-to-date technical orders and ensuring technical orders are available to the warfighter to maintain weapon systems and equipment </li>\\r\\n    <li>JEDMICS is a joint program providing life cycle management for the standard DoD repository system for digital engineering drawings and related technical data. JEDMICS is implemented throughout the three military departments and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). JEDMICS provides the capability for receiving, storing, managing, and making engineering drawings digitally available in support of DoD business and warfighter operations </li>\\r\\n    <li>The TMSS activity is a DoD mandated activity for the Air Force. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is the designated lead command for the Air Force in ensuring compliance with all TMSS mandates and directs the activity through its Electronic Systems Center (ESC) and HQ AFMC. The TMSS activity, acting as a technical extension of the TO Policy and Procedures Office, produces and maintains specifications, standards, style sheets, and associated SGML and XML digital templates. These tools are used to provide a single authoritative source of accurate, interoperable, repeatable, and reliable, real-time guidance to acquire and create digitized TO data for production of both paper and digital TOs. No software is produced by the program. The associated SGML and XML templates are used in conjunction with COTS software to produce AF digital TOs. The TMSS program also provides acquisition technical support and Technical Assessment (TA) evaluation services to support ALCs, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), and other users of TMSS products. </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The Technical Data Section PMO requires functional and technical SME services:</p>\\r\\n<p>SMEs are individuals with a specific level of expertise in certain key system areas or disciplines and are knowledgeable about the domain being represented.

Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Aerospace Systems Diretorate (AFRL/RQ) requirement for an Airframe Digital Twin (ADT).</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The US Air Force needs to decrease maintenance costs while ensuring the continued airworthiness and availability of its aircraft. Achieving this objective will require revolutionary developments in the way aircraft are managed while in service. The Air Vehicles Directorate&rsquo;s vision for how to accomplish this takes advantage of the advances in high performance computing to improve the management of aircraft through the concept of an Airframe Digital Twin. <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAn Airframe Digital Twin is a cradle-to-grave model of an airframe&rsquo;s ability to meet mission requirements. The Airframe Digital Twin, as an ultra-realistic model of the as-built and maintained airframe, is explicitly tied to the materials and manufacturing specifications, controls, and process used to build and maintain the airframe. It is a single consistent model of an individual airframe by tail number that includes all variation and uncertainty in that airframe. </p>\\r\\n<p>The Airframe Digital Twin (ADT) Spiral 1 program seeks to make the Aircraft Structural Integrity program (ASIP) more proactive by increasing the accuracy of the structural prognoses developed within the Individual Aircraft Tracking (IAT) program for each Mission Design Series (MDS). More accurate prognoses can only be developed with higher fidelity flight loads data, more realistic structural analysis models than currently used and a concerted effort to quantify and reduce modeling uncertainty over time. <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe ADT Spiral 1 program seeks to augment IAT programs through the fusion of (1) usage/environment data from on-board sensors, (2) maintenance data collected from the field and depot, and (3) data collected as part of the structural development and certification program within high fidelity, physics-based structural prognostic models. <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe key innovation within this program is the integration of three key technologies into an improved IAT procedure: (1) probabilistic structural reliability analysis (PSRA), (2) on-board and in-situ damage detection, and (3) advanced flight loads simulations. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>Overall goal of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a Prognostic and Probabilistic Individual Aircraft Tracking (P2IAT) methodology that provides better prognostic capability for fatigue cracking of metallic structures </li>\\r\\n    <li>P2IAT approach will integrate advanced flight loads simulation, airframe structural stress analysis, fatigue life analysis, probabilistic structural reliability analysis, and uncertainty quantification methods </li>\\r\\n    <li>Methodology will use higher fidelity loads derived from the flight history of the specific aircraft than the current IAT approach to achieve better prognostic results\\r\\n    <ul>\\r\\n        <li>It will be modular so that the method can be easily applied to different MDS and new analysis models can be readily integrated </li>\\r\\n    </ul>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>Uncertainty in input parameters and output variables for the P2IAT algorithms will be described by probability distributions. Confidence bounds shall be placed on both the input and output probability distributions </li>\\r\\n    <li>Criteria for when to perform structural inspections will be established based on the probability of an event occurring (e.g., a crack of a specified size existing, probability of failure, etc. </li>\\r\\n    <li>Contractor will demonstrate the effectiveness of the P2IAT approach by tracking fatigue damage in two full-scale structural experiments that simulate flight-by-flight loading </li>\\r\\n    <li>Experiments will be conducted by the government, but will be planned jointly with the contractor </li>\\r\\n</ul>\",\"duration\":\"60 month(s) base\",\"govEntity\":{\"id\":24602,\"title\":\"AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY\"},\"id\":\"OPP85461\",\"iqOppId\":85461,\"oppValue\":19970,\"primaryNAICS\":{\"id\":\"541712\",\"title\":\"Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)\",\"sizeStandard\":\"1000 Employees except 1500 Employees for Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts and 1250 Employees for Other Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Guided Missiles and Space Vehicles, their Propulsion Units, their Propulsion Units and Propu\"},\"primaryRequirement\":\"IT Services\",\"procurement\":\"The Contracting Office issued an Award on December 17, 2013 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation for $19,970,000.

Situational Awareness provides an understanding of the various spectrum emitters as well as the purpose of each emitter (i.e. commercial, military, etc.). Survivability Cueing provides the critical parameters so that as threat radar weapon systems are detected, identified, and prioritized actions can be initiated to enhance the survivability of the platform. ISR support integrates the information from the EW receiver with other ISR information to enhance information content and decision making.</p>\\n\\n<p>Historically, the timetables to develop new EW receivers have been very deliberate. The threat emitters were well defined and Radio Frequency (RF) signals were slow to change. The Background RF Environment (BRFE) emitters were sparse and analog in nature. The overall environment had a high level of predictability and was easy to segregate from one another. The emergence of commercial networks and the digitally connected world is now changing all that. Current/emerging RF environments present many more challenges. Threat systems (such as electronic steerable arrays) are becoming much more complex and unpredictable due to high speed digital signal processing technology. Systems can rapidly implement a wide range of diverse waveforms and irregular scan patterns through firmware and/or software changes. Older threats will be around for the foreseeable future, with some getting upgrades with modern digital technology.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the same time the threats are evolving, commercial networks provide completely new BRFE scenarios. RF background environments continue to expand in density and complexity and present significant challenges to current EW receiver architectures. BRFE signals are using larger parts of the RF spectrum and proliferating in numbers. The EW receiver architectures need to have the flexibility to rapidly configure/respond to both of these dynamic environments, and evolve with the RF signal environment in an expeditious and affordable manner.</p>\\n\\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>The ESCE objective consists of three main parts:&nbsp;\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t<li>The first objective is to define a functional decomposition of an innovative EW receiver architecture that will provide enhanced capability against current/emerging RF threats in relevant background environments. The architecture should provide a scalable and open framework (i.e. Open Mission Systems (OMS), Future Airborne Capability Environment, etc.) amenable to adding, upgrading or replacing existing hardware, firmware, and software functionality without any significant system redesign. The architecture should also have the capability to easily expand/grow as the threat evolves.&nbsp;</li>\\n\\t\\t<li>The second objective is to demonstrate key signal processing functions in the proposed architecture. Signal processing in this context is defined as all aspects of signal detection, emitter parameter measurement and correlation, emitter sorting, and identification.</li>\\n\\t\\t<li>The third objective is to perform a series of government assessments that will document key signal processing capabilities and assess key technologies. The Government shall provide a series of RF environments that progressively increase in complexity to assess the signal processing functions. The signal processing functions are expected to produce a signal emitter report for each emitter in all environments. The government assessment will start no later than the 16th month from contract kick-off and conclude no later than the 27th month from the contract kickoff.</li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t</li>\\n</ul>\\n\",\"duration\":\"30 months (27 months for technical / R&D potion, 3 months for report prep)\",\"govEntity\":{\"id\":129663,\"title\":\"AEROSPACE SYSTEMS

In addition, senior leaders at all levels required a near real-time snapshot of how operational entities were performing. The solution required a financial data management system capable of scaling initially from a few hundred users to more than 11,000 users around the world. The system had to be operational 24/7 to users and managers in every time zone around the world. System users at all levels needed instant access to information in order to make timely decisions.</p>\\n\\n<p>CRIS is the data warehouse decision support and analysis solution that meets these Air Force objectives. CRIS is a centralized data repository of U.S. Air Force financial budget and 2 execution, supply, and personnel and payroll data, populated by Government systems. It delivers timely, accurate, and easy to use data while providing superior support to military operations. Users can see daily business financial data anywhere in the world at any time, with some data updated multiple times a day. CRIS operates on a cross-functional data warehouse, including Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), Headquarters Air Force (HAF), command-level and base-level Financial Management (FM), Directorate of Operations (DO), and Directorate of Logistics (LG) reporting functions. Since its inception in 2001, CRIS has grown from an initial limited user base to a current user base of more than 11,000 users performing approximately 1.1 million ad hoc queries each month, with more than 90% of these queries executed in less than 10 seconds. CRIS currently contains approximately 22-plus TB of data, consisting of 90-plus billion rows of data, and database tables 1 billion rows deep.</p>\\n\\n<p>With CRIS, users can design and submit their own queries, allowing them to retrieve exactly the data that they need to see. Approximately 98% of queries submitted to CRIS are ad hoc queries. In addition to the ad hoc functionality, CRIS also offers customized pre-defined web reports.</p>\\n\\n<p>The current CRIS capability is built on a scale-out architecture using integrated software products including Microsoft&reg; SQL Server&trade; 2008 R2 Standard Edition, EntelliCache&trade;, and EntelliFusion&trade;. The software components that make up the architecture are loosely coupled allowing for the operating system, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and other software patches and upgrades to take place without the need to make changes to CRIS. This architecture provides the ability to be deployed across multiple RDBMS instances. In addition, CRIS offers a service-oriented architecture (SOA) best practice by eliminating the need for point-to-point data links and utilizes web services as a method of server communication. EntelliFusion performs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) from 15 separate financial systems, verifies the format of the input data files, and then loads the appropriate data according to predefined business rules into the CRIS data warehouse. EntelliCache functions as a query processor that performs ad hoc and standard reports on the financial data stored in the data warehouse. It is tuned to be highly efficient at conducting user queries and delivers reporting results to a web-based front end. (To clarify, a query is defined as a user requesting information and the system reporting the results.)</p>\\n\\n<p>To ensure data security, CRIS employs a common security model involving the use of roles within the system. Using the Role Server Administrator application, functional program office (SAF/FM AFFSO) personnel can define and apply roles to user accounts that define the data to which the user is granted access. CRIS uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Common Access Card (CAC) to restrict access to the system to authorized users only or other systems having DOD-issued certificates.</p>\\n\\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Redevelopment of the CRIS architecture</li>\\n\\t<li>The new CRIS product will need to have development and production environments.&nbsp; These environments will necessitate the purchase of the basic services, database administration, and storage costs through DISA.</li>\\n\\t<li>Other Software (Ancillary software associated with the system such as cybersecurity/support software as required by policy/regulation)</li>\\n\\t<li>Provide training to support the developed system. A &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; approach will be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task. Once these trainers are fully up to speed, they can be available to assist in the training the 11, 000 users.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\",\"duration\":\"Full implementation at least 18-24 months after award (Source: April 2019 J&A)\",\"govEntity\":{\"id\":126278,\"title\":\"BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS DIRECTORATE\"},\"id\":\"OPP178753\",\"iqOppId\":178753,\"oppValue\":15793,\"primaryNAICS\":{\"id\":\"541511\",\"title\":\"Custom Computer Programming Services\",\"sizeStandard\":\"$34 million annual receipts\"},\"primaryRequirement\":\"Information Technology\",\"procurement\":\"<p>This Opportunity Report has been updated to include additional task order details.
