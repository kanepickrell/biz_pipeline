In addition, senior leaders at all levels required a near real-time snapshot of how operational entities were performing. The solution required a financial data management system capable of scaling initially from a few hundred users to more than 11,000 users around the world. The system had to be operational 24/7 to users and managers in every time zone around the world. System users at all levels needed instant access to information in order to make timely decisions.</p>\n\n<p>CRIS is the data warehouse decision support and analysis solution that meets these Air Force objectives. CRIS is a centralized data repository of U.S. Air Force financial budget and 2 execution, supply, and personnel and payroll data, populated by Government systems. It delivers timely, accurate, and easy to use data while providing superior support to military operations. Users can see daily business financial data anywhere in the world at any time, with some data updated multiple times a day. CRIS operates on a cross-functional data warehouse, including Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), Headquarters Air Force (HAF), command-level and base-level Financial Management (FM), Directorate of Operations (DO), and Directorate of Logistics (LG) reporting functions. Since its inception in 2001, CRIS has grown from an initial limited user base to a current user base of more than 11,000 users performing approximately 1.1 million ad hoc queries each month, with more than 90% of these queries executed in less than 10 seconds. CRIS currently contains approximately 22-plus TB of data, consisting of 90-plus billion rows of data, and database tables 1 billion rows deep.</p>\n\n<p>With CRIS, users can design and submit their own queries, allowing them to retrieve exactly the data that they need to see. Approximately 98% of queries submitted to CRIS are ad hoc queries. In addition to the ad hoc functionality, CRIS also offers customized pre-defined web reports.</p>\n\n<p>The current CRIS capability is built on a scale-out architecture using integrated software products including Microsoft&reg; SQL Server&trade; 2008 R2 Standard Edition, EntelliCache&trade;, and EntelliFusion&trade;. The software components that make up the architecture are loosely coupled allowing for the operating system, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and other software patches and upgrades to take place without the need to make changes to CRIS. This architecture provides the ability to be deployed across multiple RDBMS instances. In addition, CRIS offers a service-oriented architecture (SOA) best practice by eliminating the need for point-to-point data links and utilizes web services as a method of server communication. EntelliFusion performs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) from 15 separate financial systems, verifies the format of the input data files, and then loads the appropriate data according to predefined business rules into the CRIS data warehouse. EntelliCache functions as a query processor that performs ad hoc and standard reports on the financial data stored in the data warehouse. It is tuned to be highly efficient at conducting user queries and delivers reporting results to a web-based front end. (To clarify, a query is defined as a user requesting information and the system reporting the results.)</p>\n\n<p>To ensure data security, CRIS employs a common security model involving the use of roles within the system. Using the Role Server Administrator application, functional program office (SAF/FM AFFSO) personnel can define and apply roles to user accounts that define the data to which the user is granted access. CRIS uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Common Access Card (CAC) to restrict access to the system to authorized users only or other systems having DOD-issued certificates.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Redevelopment of the CRIS architecture</li>\n\t<li>The new CRIS product will need to have development and production environments.&nbsp; These environments will necessitate the purchase of the basic services, database administration, and storage costs through DISA.</li>\n\t<li>Other Software (Ancillary software associated with the system such as cybersecurity/support software as required by policy/regulation)</li>\n\t<li>Provide training to support the developed system. A &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; approach will be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task. Once these trainers are fully up to speed, they can be available to assist in the training the 11, 000 users.</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"Full implementation at least 18-24 months after award (Source: April 2019 J&A)","govEntity":{"id":126278,"title":"BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP178753","iqOppId":178753,"oppValue":15793,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541511","title":"Custom Computer Programming Services","sizeStandard":"$34 million annual receipts"},"primaryRequirement":"Information Technology","procurement":"<p>This Opportunity Report has been updated to include additional task order details.

implementation of an efficient sustainment program.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>C-130H AMP Increment 2 includes multiple configurations and variations of C-130H variants.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The original design for C-130H and LC-130H aircraft included design differences for each year group and a few year groups included more than one aircraft variation.</li>\n\t\t<li>In addition, the C-130H aircraft was built using 1950&#39;s era tooling and processes resulting in variations in the aircraft primary and secondary structure.</li>\n\t\t<li>Past aircraft modifications were sometimes designed, developed, and/or installed by different teams resulting in variations in installation design, install locations, and wire routing.</li>\n\t\t<li>Some C-130H aircraft have secondary missions such as Fire Fighting and Aerial Spray that drive special considerations for those aircraft.</li>\n\t\t<li>The LC-130H aircraft are not equipped with AN/APN-169 Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) system, thus the Systems Requirement Document (SRD) requirements pertaining to SKE retention, display, and integration do not apply to the LC-130H aircraft.</li>\n\t\t<li>For many of the existing aircraft systems, wire routing is not documented or is poorly documented.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>C-130H AMP Increment 2 system integration must also accommodate multiple air vehicle performance differences due to on-going modernization of the propulsion system.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>All C-130H AMP Increment 2 aircraft will have the Electronic Prop Control System

Achieving this objective will require revolutionary developments in the way aircraft are managed while in service. The Air Vehicles Directorate&rsquo;s vision for how to accomplish this takes advantage of the advances in high performance computing to improve the management of aircraft through the concept of an Airframe Digital Twin. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn Airframe Digital Twin is a cradle-to-grave model of an airframe&rsquo;s ability to meet mission requirements. The Airframe Digital Twin, as an ultra-realistic model of the as-built and maintained airframe, is explicitly tied to the materials and manufacturing specifications, controls, and process used to build and maintain the airframe. It is a single consistent model of an individual airframe by tail number that includes all variation and uncertainty in that airframe. </p>\r\n<p>The Airframe Digital Twin (ADT) Spiral 1 program seeks to make the Aircraft Structural Integrity program (ASIP) more proactive by increasing the accuracy of the structural prognoses developed within the Individual Aircraft Tracking (IAT) program for each Mission Design Series (MDS). More accurate prognoses can only be developed with higher fidelity flight loads data, more realistic structural analysis models than currently used and a concerted effort to quantify and reduce modeling uncertainty over time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ADT Spiral 1 program seeks to augment IAT programs through the fusion of (1) usage/environment data from on-board sensors, (2) maintenance data collected from the field and depot, and (3) data collected as part of the structural development and certification program within high fidelity, physics-based structural prognostic models. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key innovation within this program is the integration of three key technologies into an improved IAT procedure: (1) probabilistic structural reliability analysis (PSRA), (2) on-board and in-situ damage detection, and (3) advanced flight loads simulations. </p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Overall goal of this effort is to develop and demonstrate a Prognostic and Probabilistic Individual Aircraft Tracking (P2IAT) methodology that provides better prognostic capability for fatigue cracking of metallic structures </li>\r\n    <li>P2IAT approach will integrate advanced flight loads simulation, airframe structural stress analysis, fatigue life analysis, probabilistic structural reliability analysis, and uncertainty quantification methods </li>\r\n    <li>Methodology will use higher fidelity loads derived from the flight history of the specific aircraft than the current IAT approach to achieve better prognostic results\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>It will be modular so that the method can be easily applied to different MDS and new analysis models can be readily integrated </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Uncertainty in input parameters and output variables for the P2IAT algorithms will be described by probability distributions. Confidence bounds shall be placed on both the input and output probability distributions </li>\r\n    <li>Criteria for when to perform structural inspections will be established based on the probability of an event occurring (e.g., a crack of a specified size existing, probability of failure, etc. </li>\r\n    <li>Contractor will demonstrate the effectiveness of the P2IAT approach by tracking fatigue damage in two full-scale structural experiments that simulate flight-by-flight loading </li>\r\n    <li>Experiments will be conducted by the government, but will be planned jointly with the contractor </li>\r\n</ul>","duration":"60 month(s) base","govEntity":{"id":24602,"title":"AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY"},"id":"OPP85461","iqOppId":85461,"oppValue":19970,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541712","title":"Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)","sizeStandard":"1000 Employees except 1500 Employees for Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts and 1250 Employees for Other Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Guided Missiles and Space Vehicles, their Propulsion Units, their Propulsion Units and Propu"},"primaryRequirement":"IT Services","procurement":"The Contracting Office issued an Award on December 17, 2013 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation for $19,970,000.

These SME services are essential in order to maintain the functionality of the systems listed below:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>ATOS is a stand alone, loose-leaf publication and document management system for Air Force TO changes. ATOS, in accordance with continuous acquisition and life-cycle support (CALS) requirements, receives stores and maintains digital tech order page change data and produces postscripts to TO pages. There are AF-operated ATOS production systems at three Air Logistics Centers (ALCs). ATOS currently supports import/export of digital data automating publishing processes for text, General Markup Language (GML), Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Indexed Portable Document Format (IPDF), and graphics (raster, vector, and computer graphics metafile) data creation; capture of loose-leaf changes; storage of digitized TO data; and acceptance of digitized TO data directly from Department of Defense (DoD) industry sources. ATOS software is a mixture of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Contractor developed software. ATOS consists of seven subsystems: production control, text capture, text generation, graphics capture, graphics generation, review and output. ATOS is the official Air Force organic system for TO production, management, storage, and maintenance. ATOS is designated as a Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III computer resource (i.e., system is necessary to conduct day-to-day business) for the AF </li>\r\n    <li>The eTOV encompasses five principal functions: transformation, eTO viewing, eTool (mobile workstation) management, distribution, and repository. Transformation is provided with a COTS product from Command Technology, Inc (CTI). The eTO Viewing is provided by both an on-line version and a disconnected or local version. The on-line version is viewed via the AF Portal in a connected mode. The disconnected or local version is viewed via an eTool based capability with TOs stored locally to support viewing while disconnected from the network. The on-line viewer software provides basic repository capabilities. Custom eTOV modules (message management, eTool management, and distribution software for master and slave eTools) were developed for the government. These eTOV modules support data exchanges with ETIMS and delivery of eTOs to designated eTools based upon the ETIMS defined and managed subscriptions. To support the transformation and initial review process, a custom developed verifier tool, provided by NCI Information Systems, Inc., supplies comparison of Portable Document Format (PDF) to Command Publishing Suite (CPS)-transformed HyperText Markup Language (HTML) eTOs. The custom developed verifier tool was developed to support comparison of eTO data with different formats. eTOV is designated as a MAC II computer resource (i.e., system is important to the support of deployed and contingency forces) for the AF </li>\r\n    <li>ETIMS provides a Global Combat Support System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) hosted capability for AF system maintainers to manage their TO and Electronic Technical Order (eTO) subscriptions and libraries. ETIMS is integrated and interfaces with the Electronic Technical Order Viewer (eTOV), Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS), and Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (JCALS) systems. The purpose of ETIMS is to provide a combination of services and interim capabilities to support TO management and use until ECSS is able to provide these services and capabilities and subsumes ETIMS. ETIMS is designated as a MAC II computer resource (i.e., system is important to the support of deployed and contingency forces) for the AF </li>\r\n    <li>JCALS is the Air Force &ldquo;System of Record&rdquo; for TO management. JCALS is a Mission Assurance Category, MAC II, Joint-Service (Air Force, Army, Navy) integrated enterprise computing project supporting the DoD Integrated Data Environment (IDE) and paperless process mandated by the Congress of the United States and downward directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). JCALS transitioned TO management from paper media to a paperless, electronic, automated digital environment. It improves business processes for TO functions, such as acquisition, recommended changes, publishing, stock management and distribution. JCALS supports the warfighter by providing up-to-date technical orders and ensuring technical orders are available to the warfighter to maintain weapon systems and equipment </li>\r\n    <li>JEDMICS is a joint program providing life cycle management for the standard DoD repository system for digital engineering drawings and related technical data. JEDMICS is implemented throughout the three military departments and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). JEDMICS provides the capability for receiving, storing, managing, and making engineering drawings digitally available in support of DoD business and warfighter operations </li>\r\n    <li>The TMSS activity is a DoD mandated activity for the Air Force. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) is the designated lead command for the Air Force in ensuring compliance with all TMSS mandates and directs the activity through its Electronic Systems Center (ESC) and HQ AFMC. The TMSS activity, acting as a technical extension of the TO Policy and Procedures Office, produces and maintains specifications, standards, style sheets, and associated SGML and XML digital templates. These tools are used to provide a single authoritative source of accurate, interoperable, repeatable, and reliable, real-time guidance to acquire and create digitized TO data for production of both paper and digital TOs. No software is produced by the program. The associated SGML and XML templates are used in conjunction with COTS software to produce AF digital TOs. The TMSS program also provides acquisition technical support and Technical Assessment (TA) evaluation services to support ALCs, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), and other users of TMSS products. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Technical Data Section PMO requires functional and technical SME services:</p>\r\n<p>SMEs are individuals with a specific level of expertise in certain key system areas or disciplines and are knowledgeable about the domain being represented.

Situational Awareness provides an understanding of the various spectrum emitters as well as the purpose of each emitter (i.e. commercial, military, etc.). Survivability Cueing provides the critical parameters so that as threat radar weapon systems are detected, identified, and prioritized actions can be initiated to enhance the survivability of the platform. ISR support integrates the information from the EW receiver with other ISR information to enhance information content and decision making.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, the timetables to develop new EW receivers have been very deliberate. The threat emitters were well defined and Radio Frequency (RF) signals were slow to change. The Background RF Environment (BRFE) emitters were sparse and analog in nature. The overall environment had a high level of predictability and was easy to segregate from one another. The emergence of commercial networks and the digitally connected world is now changing all that. Current/emerging RF environments present many more challenges. Threat systems (such as electronic steerable arrays) are becoming much more complex and unpredictable due to high speed digital signal processing technology. Systems can rapidly implement a wide range of diverse waveforms and irregular scan patterns through firmware and/or software changes. Older threats will be around for the foreseeable future, with some getting upgrades with modern digital technology.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time the threats are evolving, commercial networks provide completely new BRFE scenarios. RF background environments continue to expand in density and complexity and present significant challenges to current EW receiver architectures. BRFE signals are using larger parts of the RF spectrum and proliferating in numbers. The EW receiver architectures need to have the flexibility to rapidly configure/respond to both of these dynamic environments, and evolve with the RF signal environment in an expeditious and affordable manner.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The ESCE objective consists of three main parts:&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The first objective is to define a functional decomposition of an innovative EW receiver architecture that will provide enhanced capability against current/emerging RF threats in relevant background environments. The architecture should provide a scalable and open framework (i.e. Open Mission Systems (OMS), Future Airborne Capability Environment, etc.) amenable to adding, upgrading or replacing existing hardware, firmware, and software functionality without any significant system redesign. The architecture should also have the capability to easily expand/grow as the threat evolves.&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li>The second objective is to demonstrate key signal processing functions in the proposed architecture. Signal processing in this context is defined as all aspects of signal detection, emitter parameter measurement and correlation, emitter sorting, and identification.</li>\n\t\t<li>The third objective is to perform a series of government assessments that will document key signal processing capabilities and assess key technologies.

Rapid Sustainment Office&nbsp;has a continuing&nbsp;requirement for enterprise product support engineering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>\n\n<p>The Air Force must endeavor to find ways to modernize and sustain affordable and effective systems in a challenging fiscal constrained environment.&nbsp; For most Air Force systems, the majority of the total life-cycle cost is expended in executing product support functions in the Operations and Support phase, approximately 60-70 percent.&nbsp; For this reason, effective and efficient product support planning and execution are critical to the Air Force&rsquo;s ability to design, field, modernize and sustain affordable systems.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the Air Force makes sustainment technology decisions on a program-by-program basis.&nbsp; However, a wholly program-centric approach has inherent weaknesses.&nbsp; This existing approach does not always include consideration of other programs&rsquo; on-going initiatives which creates duplication of efforts and wastes key valuable Air Force resources.</p>\n\n<p>The enterprise mindset is an evolution from our program-centric approach to an approach that leverages synergies, seeks economies of scale, and proactively manages system and infrastructure capabilities to sustain essential government and industry product support capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The Air Force must design for supportability by maximizing commonality, modularity, open system architecture and standardization of support processes to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.&nbsp; Product support engineering solutions should maximize the use of common technology to optimize availability and reliability while reducing life-cycle costs.</p>\n\n<h4>INCUMBENT REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>Product Support Engineering supports projects that demonstrate enterprise technologies, alternative material solutions, and standardize process solutions to enable or accelerate sustainment technology transition across multiple weapon systems across the life cycle.&nbsp; This contract will address the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.&nbsp; It should bridge that gap by supporting promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration from laboratory to sustainment.&nbsp; It will allow program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to identify, integrate, prototype, test, qualify, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.&nbsp; As a minimum Product Support Engineering covers the following focus areas to ensure reduced weapon system life cycle costs and improved reliability, availability, and maintainability:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Paint/De-Paint.&nbsp;</strong> Application and removal of weapon systems organic coatings is a labor-intensive, time-consuming process that generates large amounts of hazardous waste and air emissions.&nbsp; Enterprise efforts to evaluate and implement advanced coating application and removal technologies have the potential to reduce costs, process time, rework, and hazardous materials.&nbsp; Paint/De-Paint efforts include weapon system enterprise projects such as development of a Low Observable (LO) robotic laser coating removal system; conducting complete characterization testing of laser depaint processes; investigating an automated system to paint a full aircraft; evaluating and qualifying COTS erosion-resistant low-to-zero VOC coatings; developing a robotic confined space paint system; evaluating and optimizing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) military-specification low-VOC coatings designed for plural-component robotic application; maturing and implementing a laser system for surface cleaning, preparation, and corrosion removal; adopting commercially-available re-usable masking aids for USAF use; investigate a cost-effective method to remove LO rough surface material (&ldquo;orange peel&rdquo;) using laser stripping and/or robotic sanding; and developing/implementing an automated robotic paint system for off-air-frame components.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>R&amp;M. &nbsp;</strong>Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M) Engineering focuses on ensuring end items perform as required, when needed, and are easily restored to useful condition when failures occur.&nbsp; Ensuring that R&amp;M practices are understood and employed on AF weapon systems requires investments in commercial standards; program office support for R&amp;M Engineering tool acquisition and implementation (i.e. Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis, Failure Reporting Analysis and Corrective Action System, Pareto Analysis, Reliability-Centered Maintenance, etc.); deep-dive investigations into program R&amp;M issues; tools &amp; technology for data collection, storage, and analysis; adherence to Conditioned Based Maintenance (CBM+) initiatives; R&amp;M training and materials; and other efforts to supporting program office R&amp;M focus and implementation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Engines.</strong>&nbsp; Improvements to engine sustainment technology, impacting multiple weapon systems through an enterprise approach, will reduce sustainment cost, increase organic capability, and increase availability.&nbsp; Multiple avenues for improvement are available to enhance detection, understanding, repair, and lifting of engine systems.&nbsp; Projects include enterprise automated crack detection, Engine Health Management (EHM) initiatives, and development of a service life prediction database and modeling tool for gas turbine engine components.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Manufacturing.&nbsp;</strong> Traditional manufacturing processes have proven, cost-effective methods for large production runs of simple geometries, but become highly expensive for low volume or complex parts production.&nbsp; Additive manufacturing technology has the potential to dramatically reduce cost for these niche applications and this cost savings has already been demonstrated for rapid prototyping and reverse engineering.&nbsp; Continued investment in additive manufacturing technology can advance current capabilities that lead to increases in availability and an expansion of application options.&nbsp; These cross-cutting efforts to support depot maintenance operations of legacy weapon systems include such projects as Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM), robotic-aided welding, and rapid manufacturing of nonstructural brackets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Low Observables (LO).&nbsp;</strong> LO technology provides a critical capability edge for USAF assets but comes with the increased burdens of cost, complexity, and sustainment requirements.&nbsp; Advanced technologies and techniques to inspect, quantify, standardize, qualify, and repair LO coatings, across all airborne applications, would mitigate cost and improve aircraft availability.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Rapid Technology Assessments (RTAs).</strong>&nbsp; Rapid Technology Assessments provide the capability to identify and pre-screen environmentally-friendly potential COTS technologies and/or materials for aerospace applications.&nbsp; RTAs provide recommendations on a specific technology and its supplier/vendor and include independent evaluations to assess risk, cost, and timelines for technology maturation.&nbsp; Screening tests help buy down cost and risk by evaluating whether a technology and/or product is mature, stable, and ready for comprehensive evaluation, qualification, and future implementation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Composite Repairs.&nbsp; </strong>Composite repair is a critical process for the Air Force and requires special tools, materials, and training.&nbsp; Advanced technologies and techniques are required to inspect, quantify, standardize, qualify, and repair composite materials across all weapon system applications that could mitigate cost and improve aircraft availability.&nbsp; Updates to technical orders, training materials, and tools are constantly required to stay current with changing technologies.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Energy and Environment.&nbsp; </strong>The Air Force is very dependent on energy requirements to support weapon systems.&nbsp; New innovative materials, techniques, and processes are continually being developed that could be used by the weapon system community to reduce dependence on traditional energy sources while improving availability, performance, and reducing costs.&nbsp; The Air Force will have to qualify these new materials, processes, and technologies on weapon systems before their benefits can be realized.&nbsp; In addition, environmental regulations and requirements continue to change and are becoming stricter.&nbsp; The Air Force is continually looking for materials and processes that are cleaner and more environmental friendly.&nbsp; The new materials and processes will have to be tested and qualified across the weapon system enterprise before they can be implemented across the enterprise.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Sustainment.&nbsp; </strong>The Air Force sustains numerous weapon systems using various technologies, tools, and materials.&nbsp; The AF must update technologies, tools, and materials in the sustainment, repair, and maintenance of weapon systems to bend the cost curve.&nbsp; New technologies that allow agile repair, quicker maintenance, improved readiness and reduced costs are needed.&nbsp; Technologies such as laser cleaning, adhesive bonding, additive manufacturing, digital twin, digital thread, data management are required to reduce sustainment costs.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"5 year(s)

Current autonomy approaches include a growing spectrum of techniques ranging from the well-understood to the truly novel: Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), many varieties of Neural Networks, Neuromorphic Computing, Data Exploitation and others. Together with the rapid progress of autonomy algorithms and methodologies is the equally rapid progress of hardware and software designed to support the efficient execution of autonomy. These computing solutions bring new capabilities, but also new challenges, including how best to develop applications with them, and how to integrate them into larger systems. The application space for autonomy is rapidly growing, with critical technologies like target identification and recognition, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) and UAS route planning. Finally, how best to integrate and test these new solutions within reasonable constraints of cost and risk is still not well understood, and there is need for a well-defined progression from lab prototype, through realistic System Integration Lab (SIL) testing, finally through field and flight testing for Technology Readiness Level (TRL) increase.</p>\n\n<p>SOARING OTTER will be a one step, Closed BAA to advance, evaluate and mature Air Force autonomy capabilities, leveraging the latest advancements in both the fundamental science of autonomy and ML and the most modern computing technologies designed to support them.

For most Air Force systems, the majority of the total life-cycle cost is expended in executing product support functions in the Operations and Support phase, approximately 60-70 percent.&nbsp; For this reason, effective and efficient product support planning and execution are critical to the Air Force&rsquo;s ability to design, field, modernize and sustain affordable systems.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the Air Force makes sustainment technology decisions on a program-by-program basis.&nbsp; However, a wholly program-centric approach has inherent weaknesses.&nbsp; This existing approach does not always include consideration of other programs&rsquo; on-going initiatives which creates duplication of efforts and wastes key valuable Air Force resources.</p>\n\n<p>The enterprise mindset is an evolution from our program-centric approach to an approach that leverages synergies, seeks economies of scale, and proactively manages system and infrastructure capabilities to sustain essential government and industry product support capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The Air Force must design for supportability by maximizing commonality, modularity, open system architecture and standardization of support processes to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.&nbsp; Product support engineering solutions should maximize the use of common technology to optimize availability and reliability while reducing life-cycle costs.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>Product Support Engineering supports projects that demonstrate enterprise technologies, alternative material solutions, and standardize process solutions to enable or accelerate sustainment technology transition across multiple weapon systems across the life cycle.&nbsp; This contract will address the gap that exists between when a technology is first demonstrated and when it can be successfully acquired as an operational capability.&nbsp; It should bridge that gap by supporting promising system and subsystem concepts for technology integration and demonstration from laboratory to sustainment.&nbsp; It will allow program managers (the developers and providers) and warfighters (the end users) to identify, integrate, prototype, test, qualify, and demonstrate candidate technologies and assess them in an operational environment.&nbsp; As a minimum Product Support Engineering covers the following focus areas to ensure reduced weapon system life cycle costs and improved reliability, availability, and maintainability:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Chromium-Free Alternatives.&nbsp;</strong> Chromium (Cr) is a hazardous material currently in widespread use on Air Force aircraft to protect against corrosion.&nbsp; Continued use of chromium-containing corrosion preventative coatings, sealants, and other compounds will present significant risks to both field and depot maintenance workers, along with additional issues with regulatory oversight.&nbsp; Enterprise efforts to qualify Cr-free alternatives have the potential to increase worker safety and reduce maintenance costs and hazardous waste.&nbsp; These enterprise efforts include testing of non-chrome coating systems for non-OML (outer mold line) areas; conducting standardized field evaluations or non-chrome coating systems on multiple weapon systems; evaluating commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) chromate-free corrosion-inhibiting pretreatments as alternative qualified materials; determining military suitability and qualifying COTS chromate-free low-volatile organic compound (VOC) flexible primers; developing anodizing operations alternatives; evaluating Cr-free conversion coat-dip tank processes; evaluating non-chrome sealers for anodized parts; and qualifying an Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) II non-CR corrosion coating system.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cadmium-Free Alternatives.&nbsp;</strong> Cadmium (Cd) is extensively used in USAF weapon systems because of its many positive attributes for corrosion resistance, adhesion, and lubricity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Cd is also a highly toxic carcinogen and is a direct hazard to personnel.&nbsp; Heavy regulation of Cd in the US and Europe also drives cost for compliance and protection.&nbsp; The elimination of cadmium is expected to result in annual cost savings, as related to disposal activities, avoidance of penalties related to regulatory non-compliance, and reduction or elimination of operator risks that are associated with cadmium electroplating (i.e., emissions, handling, etc.).&nbsp; Alternatives efforts include zinc-nickel plating for nuclear hardness critical items; demonstrating, validating, and implementing the COTS Dalistick Station brush plating tool; testing and qualifying the COTS Zinidal zinc-nickel solution for repair applications on DoD parts; and enterprise testing for component alternatives.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Paint/De-Paint.&nbsp;</strong> Application and removal of weapon systems organic coatings is a labor-intensive, time-consuming process that generates large amounts of hazardous waste and air emissions.&nbsp; Enterprise efforts to evaluate and implement advanced coating application and removal technologies have the potential to reduce costs, process time, rework, and hazardous materials.&nbsp; Paint/De-Paint efforts include weapon system enterprise projects such as development of a Low Observable (LO) robotic laser coating removal system; conducting complete characterization testing of laser depaint processes; investigating an automated system to paint a full aircraft; evaluating and qualifying COTS erosion-resistant low-to-zero VOC coatings; developing a robotic confined space paint system; evaluating and optimizing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) military-specification low-VOC coatings designed for plural-component robotic application; maturing and implementing a laser system for surface cleaning, preparation, and corrosion removal; adopting commercially-available re-usable masking aids for USAF use; investigate a cost-effective method to remove LO rough surface material (&ldquo;orange peel&rdquo;) using laser stripping and/or robotic sanding; and developing/implementing an automated robotic paint system for off-air-frame components.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>R&amp;M. &nbsp;</strong>Reliability &amp; Maintainability (R&amp;M) Engineering focuses on ensuring end items perform as required, when needed, and are easily restored to useful condition when failures occur.&nbsp; Ensuring that R&amp;M practices are understood and employed on AF weapon systems requires investments in commercial standards; program office support for R&amp;M Engineering tool acquisition and implementation (i.e. Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis, Failure Reporting Analysis and Corrective Action System, Pareto Analysis, Reliability-Centered Maintenance, etc.); deep-dive investigations into program R&amp;M issues; tools &amp; technology for data collection, storage, and analysis; adherence to Conditioned Based Maintenance (CBM+) initiatives; R&amp;M training and materials; and other efforts to supporting program office R&amp;M focus and implementation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Engines.</strong>&nbsp; Improvements to engine sustainment technology, impacting multiple weapon systems through an enterprise approach, will reduce sustainment cost, increase organic capability, and increase availability.&nbsp; Multiple avenues for improvement are available to enhance detection, understanding, repair, and lifting of engine systems.&nbsp; Projects include enterprise automated crack detection, Engine Health Management (EHM) initiatives, and development of a service life prediction database and modeling tool for gas turbine engine components.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Corrosion/Coating.&nbsp;</strong> Corrosion is a universal threat that concerns all weapon systems in the DoD and has direct impacts on aircraft availability, cost, and safety.&nbsp; Enterprise efforts to approve advanced weapon system coatings or utilize state-of-the-art coating technologies or corrosion resistant materials have the potential to reduce costs, process time, rework, and hazardous materials.&nbsp; These cross-cutting efforts include such projects as development of UV curable coatings; assessment of low-temperature powder coating; comparison of 4 thermoplastic coating COTS products; development and testing of sensors for corrosion detection; corrosion site surveys and assessments; corrosion technical order management and updates; and corrosion mitigation using dehumidification.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Air Force is focused on developing a Corrosion Center of Excellence and will need the tools, technologies, skills, guidance to achieve this objective.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Manufacturing.&nbsp;</strong> Traditional manufacturing processes have proven, cost-effective methods for large production runs of simple geometries, but become highly expensive for low volume or complex parts production.&nbsp; Additive manufacturing technology has the potential to dramatically reduce cost for these niche applications and this cost savings has already been demonstrated for rapid prototyping and reverse engineering.&nbsp; Continued investment in additive manufacturing technology can advance current capabilities that lead to increases in availability and an expansion of application options.&nbsp; These cross-cutting efforts to support depot maintenance operations of legacy weapon systems include such projects as Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM), robotic-aided welding, and rapid manufacturing of nonstructural brackets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI).&nbsp;</strong> NDI technologies represent the ability to inspect weapon systems for issues without altering or damaging the structure, yielding cost savings and increasing aircraft availability.&nbsp; New or improved NDI methods have the potential for detection of issues like corrosion or damage in challenging areas like unique geometries, through coatings, or at new detection thresholds.&nbsp; Automation of NDI, in conjunction with paint/de-paint or Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), also has the potential to decrease flow time and cost which will increase weapon system availability.&nbsp; These cross-cutting efforts include such projects as replacement of chemically processed x-ray film and advanced automated fluorescent dye penetrant inspection in lieu of large vats of chemicals.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Low Observables (LO).&nbsp;</strong> LO technology provides a critical capability edge for USAF assets but comes with the increased burdens of cost, complexity, and sustainment requirements.&nbsp; Advanced technologies and techniques to inspect, quantify, standardize, qualify, and repair LO coatings, across all airborne applications, would mitigate cost and improve aircraft availability.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Rapid Technology Assessments (RTAs).</strong>&nbsp; Rapid Technology Assessments provide the capability to identify and pre-screen environmentally-friendly potential COTS technologies and/or materials for aerospace applications.&nbsp; RTAs provide recommendations on a specific technology and its supplier/vendor and include independent evaluations to assess risk, cost, and timelines for technology maturation.&nbsp; Screening tests help buy down cost and risk by evaluating whether a technology and/or product is mature, stable, and ready for comprehensive evaluation, qualification, and future implementation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Composite Repairs.&nbsp; </strong>Composite repair is a critical process for the Air Force and requires special tools, materials, and training.&nbsp; Advanced technologies and techniques are required to inspect, quantify, standardize, qualify, and repair composite materials across all weapon system applications that could mitigate cost and improve aircraft availability.&nbsp; Updates to technical orders, training materials, and tools are constantly required to stay current with changing technologies.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Energy and Environment.&nbsp; </strong>The Air Force is very dependent on energy requirements to support weapon systems.&nbsp; New innovative materials, techniques, and processes are continually being developed that could be used by the weapon system community to reduce dependence on traditional energy sources while improving availability, performance, and reducing costs.&nbsp; The Air Force will have to qualify these new materials, processes, and technologies on weapon systems before their benefits can be realized.&nbsp; In addition, environmental regulations and requirements continue to change and are becoming stricter.&nbsp; The Air Force is continually looking for materials and processes that are cleaner and more environmental friendly.&nbsp; The new materials and processes will have to be tested and qualified across the weapon system enterprise before they can be implemented across the enterprise.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Sustainment.&nbsp; </strong>The Air Force sustains numerous weapon systems using various technologies, tools, and materials.&nbsp; The AF must update technologies, tools, and materials in the sustainment, repair, and maintenance of weapon systems to bend the cost curve.&nbsp; New technologies that allow agile repair, quicker maintenance, improved readiness and reduced costs are needed.&nbsp; Technologies such as laser cleaning, adhesive bonding, additive manufacturing, digital twin, digital thread, data management are required to reduce sustainment costs.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"5 year(s) base","govEntity":{"id":129656,"title":"TECHNICAL ENGINEERING SERVICES DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP167155","iqOppId":167155,"oppValue":350000,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541330","title":"Engineering Services","sizeStandard":"$25.5 million annual receipts except $47.0 million annual receipts for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons and Contracts and Subcontracts for Engineering Services Awarded Under the National Energy Policy of 1992 and Marine"},"primaryRequirement":"Engineering, Scientific and Technical Services","procurement":"<p>Deltek is monitoring the anticipated follow-on for this effort under Opportunity Report: <a href=\"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/228282\">228282</a>.</p>\n","smartTag":"Products & Services > Primary Tags:Engineering services, Secondary Tags:Cost estimation services, Infrastructure inspection services, Systems engineering services, ","smartTagObject":[{"id":"CD22361A-B390-4092-A830-A878E03DA136","name":"Engineering services","type":"Services","isPrimary":1},{"id":"8A9EDCC9-D0BB-5776-BB5A-1E84871739ED","name":"Cost estimation services","type":"Services","isPrimary":0},{"id":"3C87B0D7-26C3-4CA2-87FE-5E248140ABB4","name":"Infrastructure inspection services","type":"Services","isPrimary":0},{"id":"AD8E68D4-7BD9-4600-B108-5624FC530E8C","name":"Systems engineering services","type":"Services","isPrimary":0}],"solicitationDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2018-05-18T00:00:00.000"},"solicitationNumber":"ID05180026","sourceURL":"https://sam.gov/opp/5c3180e958fd7d73fe0841f8f7f460a1/view","status":"Awarded","title":"ENTERPRISE PRODUCT SUPPORT ENGINEERING IV (EPSE IV)","type":"trackedopp","typeOfAward":"IDIQ - Agency Specific","updateDate":"2023-02-02T11:44:26.437"},{"links":{"webHref":{"href":"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/98619"},"contacts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/contacts"},"relatedDocuments":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/relatedDocuments"},"markedByUsers":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/markedByUsers"},"placesOfPerformance":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/placesOfPerformance"},"govEntity":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/govEntities/24606"},"fboNotices":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/fboNotices"},"relatedArticles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/relatedArticles"},"contractVehicles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/contractVehicles"},"verticals":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/verticals"},"assessment":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/assessment"},"companies":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/companies"},"milestones":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/milestones"},"contracts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP98619/contracts"}},"acronym":"AVIPSS V","awardDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2015-06-23T00:00:00.000"},"competitionTypes":[{"id":40,"title":"Full and Open / Unrestricted"}],"contractTypes":[{"id":9,"title":"Cost Plus Fixed Fee"},{"id":30,"title":"Task Order"}],"country":"USA","createdDate":"2013-04-09T00:00:00.000","description":"<p>Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. is fulfilling the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site (RRS), Information Directorate requirement for an Automated Virtual Information Production Support System (AVIPSS) V.</p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>These requirements are not based upon the current Solicitation.&nbsp;Vendors are encouraged to monitor their OASIS portals for additional information.

Since 1917, when the directorate&nbsp; was activated as the Materials Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate and its predecessors have played key roles in research and development efforts that have advanced aerospace capabilities to where they are today. In fact, current state-of-the-art systems such as Stealth, F-22, Airborne Laser, and modern cockpits all started as Air Force Research Laboratory projects. From early aerospace materials of plywood and cloth to modern advanced composite materials for spacecraft, the people of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate have always responded to the challenge of developing materials and processing methods to make better airborne systems and keep the United States Air Force at the cutting edge of flight technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"r5\">As one of the Air Force Research Laboratory's 10 technology directorates, ML performs comprehensive research and development activities to provide new or improved materials, processes and manufacturing technologies for the U.S. Air Force. Scientists and engineers at the directorate explore these technologies for use in aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, rockets, and ground-based systems, and their structural, electronic and optical components. In addition, the directorate integrates industry requirements with an execution program providing advanced manufacturing processes, techniques and systems for timely, reliable, high-quality, economical production and sustainment of Air Force systems. Areas of expertise include thermal protection materials, metallic and nonmetallic structural materials, nondestructive inspection, materials for aerospace propulsion systems, electromagnetic and electronic materials, and laser hardened materials.</p>\r\nThe <span class=\"bold\">Manufacturing Technology or ManTech Division</span> integrates Air Force and industry requirements to execute programs that provide advanced manufacturing processes, techniques, and systems for timely, reliable, high-quality and economical production and sustainment of Air Force systems. The division addresses affordability issues related to acquisition reform, business practices/policies, supplier practices/relationships, and implements principles to reduce cost and cycle time while improving weapon systems and their components. Research in the design and control of materials processes is also conducted by the division.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>REQUIREMENTS<br />\r\n</strong><br />\r\nAir Force Research Laboratory,&nbsp;Manufacturing Technology Division of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, (AFRL/MLM ) solicits research proposals for the Affordable Weapons' Datalink Insertion (AWDI) Program.&nbsp;The objective of this program is to develop, demonstrate and implement advanced Manufacturing processes and practices that demonstrably reduce cost and mfg. cycle times associated with the transition of emerging weapon data link systems into Air Force munitions SDD/LRIP/FRP programs.&nbsp;Focus will be toward the pursuit of aggressive product and process technologies that can dramatically reduce WDL fly away costs from their current baseline to below $5000/unit by FY10. The primary transition target for this effort is Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB-II).&nbsp;However, solution applicability to multiple systems is a premium and interim transition onto other PGM systems (i.e. JASSM) prior to FY10 is also highly desirable. A successful program will result in commitment to fully implement the developed processes and practices as well as a transition plan with SPO buy-in to incorporate the improved WDL product and processes onto their respective system.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />","duration":"44 month(s) base","govEntity":{"id":24607,"title":"MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP35146","iqOppId":35146,"oppValue":11100,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541710","title":"Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences","sizeStandard":"500 Employees except 1500 Employees for Aircraft and 1000 Employees for Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Aircraft Engine Parts and Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their Propulsion Units, their Propulsion Units, their Propuls"},"primaryRequirement":"Research & Development","procurement":"The Contracting Office made an additional award to Harris Corporation on September 29, 2006 for around $6.2 million.

AFLCMC/WNS at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio is responsible for end-to-end lifecycle management of AF training systems encompassing complex aircrew, maintenance, and system-specific training systems in support of warfighter training at operating locations worldwide. AFLCMC/WNS customers include AF active duty, reserve, and National Guard and Department of Defense (DoD) joint warfighter as well as Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Aircraft platforms supported include: fighter, bomber, cargo/airlift/tanker, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and special operations that include helicopter platforms. Training system performance parameters are defined by requirements unique to each customer&rsquo;s mission and unique training needs.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Capability Required:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Performance-based acquisition of training systems encompassing the tasks of analysis, design, development, production, installation, integration, test, database generation and sustainment. Sustainment of fielded simulation systems entails system modification, upgrades, maintenance, and follow-on production activities</li>\n\t\t<li>System modernization and modification is required to ensure accurate representation of aircraft capabilities, described as maintaining concurrency with operational aircraft as well as, technology insertion to address obsolescence issues that ensures continued system viability</li>\n\t\t<li>The sustainment of AF training systems is accomplished via Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), which include elements of follow-on development, production, modernization, and support as well as training-related services such as courseware maintenance, academic/simulator instruction and security support</li>\n\t\t<li>Capabilities replicated in training simulations include aircraft operations, weapons employment, navigation, and command and control. Simulation systems deliver the full range of required training from individual and aircrew events in a single aircraft to large-scale, theater specific, composite force mission rehearsal training. Training systems support initial qualification, upgrade, continuation, and mission rehearsal training. Maintenance training systems support the training of aircraft maintenance procedures specific to major subsystems of an aircraft platform that may include diagnostic and/or remove and replace tasks. System-specific training systems provide solutions to unique training needs, such as the Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTCTRS) that provides mission-rehearsal training scenarios to the Forward Air Controllers</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Systems Description:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The capabilities to be procured under TSAS contracts range from the acquisition and support of extremely complex system of systems to the basic sustainment of a single trainer. Some of the factors which contribute to program complexity include the phase of the system lifecycle, the complexity of the platform being simulated, interoperability to other systems, the number of systems and operating locations to be supported, and specific technical solutions implemented</li>\n\t\t<li>A Total Training System is a complex system of systems that includes a full complement of aircrew and maintenance trainers that together with academic instruction support the training required to execute weapon system mission(s)</li>\n\t\t<li>Acquisition of a complex system of systems includes the development, production, and sustainment of Aircrew Training Devices. Such systems require high-fidelity simulation training as defined by the using organization and/or Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) certifications. For example, a high-fidelity training device in support of the AF&#39;s mobility mission simulates aircraft capabilities and also incorporates motion capability as well as realistic out-the-window displays to deliver immersive training. These types of training systems are also capable of linking with local and geographically-separated training systems to conduct training operations</li>\n\t\t<li>System of systems may also include acquisition and support of Maintenance Training Devices. Acquisition and sustainment of complex systems typically delivers multiple training operations at multiple locations worldwide</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>At the other end of the range of capabilities to be procured would be the sustainment of a single type of training device with a single configuration. Absent are the requirements for high-fidelity training and/or local or long-haul connectivity with other training systems. Such a program typically requires little modernization or follow-on production. Emphasis is placed on operations and maintenance to include routine device upgrades in support of training at a limited number of operating locations, usually US-based</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"5 year base with one 2-year option and one 3-year option","govEntity":{"id":127885,"title":"AGILE COMBAT SUPPORT DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP183850","iqOppId":183850,"oppValue":32500000,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"336413","title":"Other Aircraft Part and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing","sizeStandard":"1250 Employees"},"primaryRequirement":"IT Services","procurement":"<p>The TSA IV effort has been awarded. according to defense.gov.

During this contract the DEAMS Functional Management Office (FMO) will provide product owner and testing support to the agile software development of the Air Force&rsquo;s highest priority functionality, provide user training, business process reengineering and sustain an unmodified System and Organizational Controls audit. The Air Force Accounting Operations Center (AFAOC) will continue to improve communication, market knowledge management tools to increase user self- sufficiency, provide consistent support to all DEAMS bases, while supporting audit requirements and developing and improving preventative controls.</p>\n\n<p>DEAMS is a Business Capability Acquisition Category (BCAT) 1 program for the United States Air Force (USAF) (Priority defense business system expected to have a total amount of budget authority over the period of the current Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) in excess of $250,000,000). Once fully implemented throughout the Air Force, DEAMS will support the guidelines established by the Office of the Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer (DCMO), as well as adhere to OMB Circular A-123 and other relevant laws, regulations, and policies.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The DEAMS objective is to replace the Air Force&rsquo;s legacy accounting and financial systems by applying DoD mandated policies and processes to a commercially supported software solution. DEAMS delivers the core accounting and financial reporting system to support all Air Force Commands and Unified Commands where the Air Force is the executive agent (i.e. United States Space Force). As an integrated core accounting system, DEAMS is a critical enabler of all Air Force business system modernization programs and is the foundation for sustaining financial statement auditability across the DoD. DEAMS serves as the target core financial system for all Air Force financial and mixed financial system modernization and development programs.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Currently the DEAMS application is deployed to 17,000 users at all 170 Air Force (Active Duty, Reserve, and Air National Guard) and Space Force installations and five DFAS field sites. During this task order the DEAMS Functional Management Office (FMO) will continue to provide training to new and existing users on new functionality, changes to business processes, and transitioning from legacy systems. The DEAMS FMO will also support agile backlog management, agile software development and acceptance testing for new functionality and mitigating defects from previous software releases.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The FMO will also serve as the DEAMS program audit focal point by tracking responses, preparing documentation, and implementing a control environment to support system and financial statement audits. The Air Force Accounting Operations Center (AFAOC) will be the central hub for all DEAMS field and operational support questions, as well as publishing communication with FM personnel as it pertains to DEAMS, and AF initiatives. Additionally, the AFAOC will perform incident management, systems operations and management, performance analysis, problem resolution, customer support, compliance, and sustainment education/training for DEAMS. <em>(Source: March 2023 J&amp;A)</em></p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>General: This is a non-personal services contract to provide support to the DEAMS Functional Management Office (FMO) located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH.</p>\n\n<p>Description of Services/Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform deployment, operations, and sustainment of the DEAMS as defined in this PWS except for those items specified as Government furnished property and services.

Simulation systems deliver the full range of required training from individual and aircrew events in a single aircraft to large-scale, theater specific, composite force mission rehearsal training. Training systems support initial qualification, upgrade, continuation, and mission rehearsal training. Maintenance training systems support the training of aircraft maintenance procedures specific to major subsystems of an aircraft platform that may include diagnostic and/or remove and replace tasks. System-specific training systems provide solutions to unique training needs, such as the Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTCTRS) that provides mission-rehearsal training scenarios to the Forward Air Controllers</div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<div class=\"widget\">Systems Description:</div>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<div class=\"widget\">The capabilities to be procured under TSAS contracts range from the acquisition and support of extremely complex system of systems to the basic sustainment of a single trainer. Some of the factors which contribute to program complexity include the phase of the system lifecycle, complexity of the platform being simulated, interoperability to other systems, the number of systems and operating locations to be supported, and specific technical solutions implemented</div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<div class=\"widget\">A Total Training System is a complex system of systems that includes a full complement of aircrew and maintenance trainers that together with academic instruction support the training required to execute weapon system mission(s)</div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<div class=\"widget\">Acquisition of a complex system of systems includes development, production and sustainment of Aircrew Training Devices. Such systems require high-fidelity simulation training as defined by the using organization and/or Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) certifications. For example, a high-fidelity training device in support of the AF&#39;s mobility mission simulates aircraft capabilities and also incorporates motion capability as well as realistic out-the-window displays to deliver immersive training. These types of training systems are also capable of linking with local and geographically-separated training systems to conduct training operations</div>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<div class=\"widget\">System of systems may also include acquisition and support of Maintenance Training Devices.

SAM forecasts wartime sortie and mission generation based on existing logistics resource levels. SAM also forecasts the expected number of available aircraft on any given day of war and identifies specific factors limiting war-fighting capabilities. SAM accomplishes limited &ldquo;What-If&rdquo; assessment capability in support of and in response to operations planner decision processes</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tRequirements/Execution Availability Logistics Module (REALM)/D087H, an unclassified system maintained and operated at GCSS-AF, is the Air Force corporate database for Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) and High Priority Mission Support Kits (HPMSK). REALM facilitates the exchange of RSP and HPMSK information among Air Force commands and organizations. REALM supports reviews of the range of items in RSP and HPMSK and computes the depth of spares requirements for RSP.

Specifically, PRS computes spare engine levels and overhaul requirements and provides Engine Acquisition Managers (EAM) with the capability to compute buying requirements for new engines</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tRSP/Readiness Computation and Assessment System (RCAS)/D087R, an unclassified system maintained and operated at DISA, provides assessment support for the combat readiness of a weapon system to launch the first combat sortie, including aircraft engines, and recoverable spares required to conduct wartime missions. RCAS accomplishes assessments by comparing actual inventory, status, and utilization data with availability and mission capability requirements. Readiness can be analyzed for each weapon system at the mission/design/series, command, and base/unit level. RCAS focuses on historical, current, peacetime, and projected short-term asset availability. RCAS identifies the readiness and sustainment limiting items so they can be passed to the Supportability Analysis Visibility (SAV)/D087V module</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tSAV/D087V, an unclassified system maintained and operated at DISA, provides Mission Capable (MICAP), Awaiting Parts (AWP), Air Force Readiness Driver Program (AFRDP), Maintenance and Weapon System analysis and reports.

AFRL intends for AFSIM to support multi-domain, multi-resolution MS&amp;A activities ranging from engineering to mission-level into campaign. Beyond the framework itself, AFRL develops and maintains an extensive AFSIM-compatible toolset including applications to ease scenario and model creation, improve results visualization, and enhance operator-in/on-the-loop interactions.</p>\n\n<p>AFSIM and its ecosystem of tools have evolved significantly over the past 15 years. Created out of frustration with legacy Air Force MS&amp;A tools, AFSIM originally provided a flexible solution to study advanced technology concepts within the air domain at the mission-level. AFRL has since expanded AFSIM&rsquo;s capabilities to partially address all warfighting domains (air, land, sea, space, cyber) as well as spectrum of simulation needs from the engineering-level to the campaign-level. The AFSIM community, including government and industry users across the DoD and Intelligence Community (IC), have encouraged these investments by continuing to supply AFRL with new and challenging requirements. Meanwhile, growing interest in AFSIM has postured the framework to become a common tool in the DoD&rsquo;s MS&amp;A toolbox. To date, AFRL has distributed AFSIM to over 300 government and industry organizations and trained over 1500 AFSIM users and developers.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Support comprehensive MDO MS&amp;A for the rapid study of emerging military technology concepts. Rich multi-domain representations help technologists, engineers, and analysts better assess military utility, evaluate architectural tradeoffs, and make informed engineering decisions</li>\n\t<li>Enhance Air Combat Operations Capabilities\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Beginning with its legacy heritage and continued through Air Force sponsorship, AFSIM has incrementally improved its representation of air assets and their agency through combat behaviors and tactics. Investments to-date have helped reduce the time required to develop new aircraft and missile models sensitive to physics-based effects (e.g., aerodynamics, aircraft handling characteristics, propulsion), imbue those models with script-based perception and cognition, and understand their performance through visualization and analysis tools. Continued expansion and maturation of these investments will ensure that AFSIM can meaningfully contribute to the development next-generation air dominance capabilities. This initiative focuses on building up AFSIM&rsquo;s catalog of air asset models, expanding its library of modular air combat behaviors and tactics, and improving the methods and tools by which end-users can generate, compose, and explore those behaviors.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Enhance Space Operations Capabilities\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Spaceborne capabilities have become an integral part of modern terrestrial warfare.&nbsp; As a result, mission and campaign-level simulation requires increasingly more detail in the depiction of space operations. The ubiquity of space effects on all warfighting domains drives a real need for &ldquo;boxset&rdquo; space capabilities to accommodate multiple levels of fidelity and degrees of configurability. While some end-users need authoritative, &ldquo;plug-n-play&rdquo; model assets to build a plausible space context, others require more flexibility to explore system-of-system tradespaces characterized by the performance of these spaceborne assets. Over the past several years, AFRL has invested significantly in improving AFSIM&rsquo;s representation of the space domain. Capabilities range from space weather modeling, to common propagator models, to visual tools that aid in the rapid creation of satellite constellations. This initiative intends to expand AFSIM&rsquo;s space operations capabilities in the form of models and supporting tools while balancing needs across the user community.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Enhance Cyber and EW Operations Capabilities\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Success in modern warfare depends upon the control and flow of information, the ability to disrupt or influence an adversary&rsquo;s decision-making process, and the capacity to defend against the same. In order to maintain strategic advantage, the DoD continues to emphasize the criticality of information operations characterized by dominance of the entire electromagnetic spectrum and vital communications, command, and control networks and systems (JP 3-51). The capacity of U.S. adversaries to sense or affect the electromagnetic spectrum and vital defense systems presents a particular challenge for scientists, engineers, and analysts developing future weapon systems. Likewise, new materiel solutions (including both red and blue systems) often present new attack surfaces, exploited exclusively through the electromagnetic/information environment. AFSIM has traditionally represented the aggregate mission-level effects of electromagnetic and information operations on modeled systems and networks. While this level of fidelity has satisfied basic operational effectiveness studies, it strains to support studies that require more spatially and temporally accurate detail about the electromagnetic/information environment and interactions therein. This initiative intends to improve the capacity of &ldquo;boxset&rdquo; models to participate in these contested environments while providing end-users with a powerful set of analytical tools to master its effects.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Expand Threat Representations\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The DoD has steadily increased its reliance on MS&amp;A to make significant S&amp;T investment and acquisition decisions. With limited resources and significant opportunity cost at stake, decision makers have likewise raised the bar for technologists and analysts to defend the credibility of their analyses. A successful defense generally begins with the use of traceable, pedigreed, validated, or otherwise authoritative, intelligence-derived models and scenarios. The AFSIM &ldquo;boxset&rdquo; should provide both end-users and decision makers alike with the evidence necessary to substantiate critical claims and arguments expressed through simulation. Ideally, system owners and intelligence agencies would provide end-users with comprehensive data on both foreign and friendly system-of-systems representations. Unfortunately, the DoD has yet to establish an accessible model clearinghouse inclusive of all warfighting domains and concerns. Where data exists, end-users must often make informed inferences or &ldquo;port&rdquo; existing models between frameworks and simulation environments. These translation steps introduce new sources of error and analytical doubt. To improve analytical credibility, AFRL intends to focus on the continuous and incremental expansion of authoritative, intelligence-derived threat representations and scenarios in AFSIM. These threat representations should come from supported IC model product lines, ensuring that the IC remain the recognized source for authoritative, intelligence-derived models in AFSIM. Model production should include commensurate investment in the tooling and processes necessary to accelerate threat modeling, integration, and verification in AFSIM.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Expand Joint Operations Capabilities\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>AFRL intends for AFSIM to become a commodity tool useful across the entire defense M&amp;SA community. Toward this end, the AFSIM user community has grown significantly over the past seven years and now includes representation across all military services and intelligence production centers. While AFRL does not intend to fashion AFSIM as a replacement for service and domain-specific models, it does intend to improve its representation of joint operations capabilities. More specifically, a meaningful pivot towards all-domain analysis requires balanced attention to the maritime and land operational domains. Historically underrepresented in AFSIM &ldquo;boxset&rdquo; scenarios and models, investments in these domains can help &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; new capabilities while re-imagining the future of U.S. combat operations.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"4 years","govEntity":{"id":129663,"title":"AEROSPACE SYSTEMS DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP191140","iqOppId":191140,"oppValue":48000,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541715","title":"Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology)","sizeStandard":"1000 Employees except 1500 Employees for Aircraft, Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts, 1250 Employees for Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment and 1300 Employees for Guided Missiles and Space Vehicles, Their Propulsion Units and Propu"},"primaryRequirement":"Research & Development","procurement":"<p>According to a Defense article released on June 29, 2021, Stellar Science Ltd.

The primary purpose of the DM CODB is to consolidate and provide data for the production management of the Depot repair and maintenance process for the Air Force Enterprise. It is an operational-level data environment, serving on-line transaction processing applications for managing day-to-day operations in the Air Force aircraft maintenance depots. As these applications were modernized, technically refreshed, or rehosted, their data was loaded into the DM CODB. This environment then became their common source of data, receives their data updates, and sends and receives their data interfaces. The DM CODB does not absorb any of the primary functional logic of the DMSI application systems, but performs their data retrieval and updates, their interfaces, and scripts needed to produce the interfaces. Through these operational applications, the DM CODB supports AFMC users worldwide, including inventory management specialists, maintenance specialists, equipment specialists, fund monitors, and quality assurance specialists.<br />\n<br />\nThe DM CODB provides corporate-level data to support AFMC tactical and strategic planning activities. As operational applications are technically refreshed, they are enhanced with new user capabilities for reporting and on-line analytical processing (OLAP).

The AMP course is composed of three increments: AMP 101, AMP 201, and AMP 202. AMP increments 101 and 202 utilize an Aeromedical Aviation Laboratory (AAL) to introduce AMP students to military flight operations. The Aeromedical Aviation Laboratory curriculum is specifically designed to expose flight surgeon students to the rigors of flying, mission planning, modern cockpit symbology, disorientation, instrument procedures, aerobatics, low-level navigation, and formation flight in a setting that closely mirrors USAF Undergraduate Flight Training (UFT). AAL provides each AMP 101 student with one flight sortie of one hour duration and AMP 202 students with 6 sorties totaling 8 flight hours. The purpose of the AAL program is to ensure all flight surgeon candidates receive flight experiences and complete the syllabus at Appendix A-2.</p>\n\n<p>The USAFSAM also sponsors a resident in aerospace medicine (RAM) program designed to enhance, motivate, and prepare these RAMs to make sound aeromedical decisions regarding aircrew member&rsquo;s fitness to fly, to evaluate physiological threats in the flying environment, and to research, identify, and design performance enhancements for aerospace vehicles and personnel. The AAL Aviation Competency Program (ACP) was developed to help accomplish these objectives. The ACP is a two year program and is broken out into two modules A and B. Module A includes 27 hours of academic training and provides each RAM with 14 sorties totaling 19.5 flight hours. Module B includes 22 hours of academic training and provides each second year RAM an additional 5 sorties totaling 7.5 flight hours of more advanced training.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The first objective of the AAL program is to provide the student flight surgeon insight to the human response to the flight environment.</li>\n\t<li>The second is to develop the student USAF flight surgeon into a valued combat crew member regardless of the weapon system to which they are assigned.</li>\n\t<li>The final objective is to provide the equivalent of six to eight months of operational military flight surgeon experience to USAFSAM AMP graduates.</li>\n\t<li>The AAL shall enhance the students&rsquo; ability to succeed in flight medicine by jump-starting the development of the student&rsquo;s military aviation experience while igniting the students&rsquo; passion for flight medicine.</li>\n\t<li>This program shall train students to the skill levels required to complete their AAL syllabus.</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"1 year(s) base plus 4 x 1 year(s) option(s) ","govEntity":{"id":127906,"title":"711TH HUMAN PERFORMANCE WING"},"id":"OPP103280","iqOppId":103280,"oppValue":2745,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"611512","title":"Flight Training","sizeStandard":"$34 million annual receipts"},"primaryRequirement":"Education & Training","procurement":"<p>A follow-on is currently being tracked under Opportunity Report <a href=\"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/202320\">202320</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Please see Opportunity Report <a href=\"http://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/202320\">202320</a> for updates and developments. </p>\n","smartTag":"Products & Services > Primary Tags:Flight training services, Secondary Tags:Aircraft repair services, ","smartTagObject":[{"id":"8E40E3FC-3D16-54CC-9152-D22E22B0B946","name":"Flight training services","type":"Services","isPrimary":1},{"id":"5F031A89-3C92-4AAB-A64B-A08EB4C457C2","name":"Aircraft repair services","type":"Services","isPrimary":0},{"id":"8609BCD9-FFA8-5C38-B8D6-7686B98C52C7","name":"Airports","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0},{"id":"E448260B-A290-5E7A-A11A-048859665791","name":"Educational facilities","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0},{"id":"533F7C7D-FEAD-5433-852C-EF1ACB97A08D","name":"Laboratories","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0},{"id":"D317A456-B7A1-5240-9727-9ECF9135B455","name":"Offices","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0},{"id":"977B8A0B-E245-54E5-AF89-B7E73734F4FF","name":"Residential facilities","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0}],"solicitationDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2016-08-31T00:00:00.000"},"solicitationNumber":"FA865016R4103","sourceURL":"https://sam.gov/opp/320567ee5b144b7ca5d9c336cc2922a0/view","status":"Awarded","title":"USAFSAM AEROMEDICAL AVIATION LABORATORY PROGRAM (AAL)","type":"trackedopp","typeOfAward":"Other","updateDate":"2021-02-18T16:28:04.123"},{"links":{"webHref":{"href":"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/69622"},"contacts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/contacts"},"relatedDocuments":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/relatedDocuments"},"markedByUsers":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/markedByUsers"},"placesOfPerformance":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/placesOfPerformance"},"govEntity":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/govEntities/127885"},"fboNotices":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/fboNotices"},"sourcedFrom":[{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/FBO583085"}],"relatedArticles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/relatedArticles"},"contractVehicles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/contractVehicles"},"verticals":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/verticals"},"assessment":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/assessment"},"companies":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/companies"},"milestones":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/milestones"},"contracts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP69622/contracts"}},"acronym":"CAF DMO)(DMON 2.0","awardDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2013-06-27T00:00:00.000"},"competitionTypes":[{"id":40,"title":"Full and Open / Unrestricted"}],"contractTypes":[{"id":1,"title":"Firm Fixed Price"},{"id":13,"title":"Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity"}],"country":"USA","createdDate":"2011-04-07T00:00:00.000","description":"<p>Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation is fulfilling the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Agile Combat Support Directorate, Simulators Division (ASC/WNS) requirement for cost effective network architecture and concept of operations for a turnkey solution for Combat Air Force Distributed Mission Operations (CAF DMO) Operations and Integration.</p>\n\n<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>\n\n<p>The mission of Fighters &amp;

of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and sub contract.</p>\r\n<p>The Commanders&rsquo; Resource Integration System (CRIS) provides Headquarters Air Force Level, MAJCOM level, Wing Commanders, Financial Managers, and Resource Managers with the ability to make informed decisions concerning resource allocation through a set of decision support tools.<br /><br />CRIS uses three advanced technologies to provide the users with an analysis tool that provides visibility to data that provides answers. These main technologies are data warehousing, query tools, and Online Analytical Processor (OLAP).<br /><br />File transfers are made using both Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) utilizing Secure Web Internet File Transfer (SWIFT) servers with Visual Basic 6.0 code and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFPT)<br /><br />CRIS also has two different query tools for the analyst to distinguish the type of data that is required to analyze.<br /><br />The first query tool provides for a Web interface that provides very brief, but detailed information. The Web reports have limited customization but provide a quick means to view the data and the ability to locate variances in the program being queried. The CRIS tool allows analysts and leaders at all levels to quickly identify problem areas, resolve issues, and reallocate resources to meet developing needs.<br /><br />The second tool is a client tool that provides the user very detailed and tailored information on a near real-time basis. The query analysis tool uses OLAP) technology. Currently the OLAP tool is proprietary software called &ldquo;Info Analyst&rdquo; and potential vendor&rsquo;s must be able to support Info Analyst.

DMSI is comprised of six components and a consolidated data base:</p>\n\n<p>Depot Maintenance Systems Integration (DMSI):</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>G005M (Depot Maintenance Materiel Support System (DMMSS)</li>\n\t<li>E046B (AFMC Labor Standards Data System (ALSDS)</li>\n\t<li>G337 (Inventory Tracking System (ITS)</li>\n\t<li>G004L (Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS)</li>\n\t<li>G402A (Exchangeables Production System (EPS)</li>\n\t<li>097 (Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS)</li>\n\t<li>Q302 (Depot Maintenance Consolidated Data Base (DM CODB)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The architecture that integrates these six components is the Spectrum System Development Architecture (SSDA).&nbsp; The SSDA is an established framework that provides for consistent delivery and implementation of software system development using the SAP (formerly Sybase) toolset.&nbsp; The SSDA is not an application, and it does not dictate the implementation of any business solution.&nbsp; It is an architecture that brings a level of rigor, consistency, and predictability to the development of quality applications in a client/server and/or web environment to all of Depot Maintenance System Integration (DMSI) Components.&nbsp; It allows for DMSI to build standard, structured, and scalable enterprise level applications.</p>\n\n<p>The SSDA provides a standard infrastructure design for the DMSI components and a host of common application services.&nbsp; This infrastructure includes software components, class libraries, objects, System Business Transactions (SBT) templates, System Select Transactions (SST), and System Utility templates (SUT) proprietary to NCI Information Systems, Inc.&nbsp; These elements are implemented into Sybase PowerBuilder, EAServer, and Oracle Procedural Language/Structured Query Language (PL/SQL) and known as the SSDA Framework.</p>\n\n<p>The SSDA provides the following common reusable services:&nbsp; Administration Module, Application Level/role based Security, Error Handling, Transaction Management, Common GUI Look &amp; Feel, Object/Component Management, Application Scenarios, Application Partitioning, Broadcast Messaging, Report Engine, AF Portal Ready and Audit Logging.&nbsp; These basic infrastructure services are mandatory for any type of application/system and are used by all of the DMSI components which directly equates to a cost savings to DMSI because the components benefit from these common standard services without having to expend the resources and time to develop and/or maintain them across their application and/or the DMSI enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>The SSDA supports two distinct environments, client/server and web, and both leverages the SAP&rsquo;s open standards tools (i.e. Enterprise Application Server and PowerBuilder) and technologies.&nbsp; The SSDA also uses many other industry standard technologies and tools such as Java Server Pages (JSPs), JSP Tags, JavaScript, Oracle stored procedures, PL/SQL, XML, JavaBeans, Cascading Style Sheets (CCS), and smlPortal. DMSI has six applications, deployed into production at Tinker AFB, Hill AFB, and Warner-Robins AFB, two client/server and four web-based applications.</p>\n\n<p><b>REQUIREMENTS:</b></p>\n\n<p>The Contractor shall provide the technical capability in seven (7) critical areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Complete understanding of the SSDA and authority to modify the proprietary source code it contains.</li>\n\t<li>Perform software maintenance on applications which operate within the AF or DoD computing environment using:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Ability to provide guidance/training of the SSDA</li>\n\t\t<li>Client/Server and Web Development</li>\n\t\t<li>SSDA Development and Sustainment</li>\n\t\t<li>Requirements Analysis</li>\n\t\t<li>Configuration Control</li>\n\t\t<li>Software Analysis and Evaluation</li>\n\t\t<li>Design, Development, Test, and Deploy Processes</li>\n\t\t<li>Level 2/3 Help Desk</li>\n\t\t<li>Understanding of all six of the DMSI Components and how each utilizes the SSDA</li>\n\t\t<li>Understanding of the Q302 CODB</li>\n\t\t<li>Understanding the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Environments</li>\n\t\t<li>Infrastructure/Technology upgrades</li>\n\t\t<li>PowerBuilder and EAServer</li>\n\t\t<li>NetBeans, RoboHelp, PowerGen, OpenSTA</li>\n\t\t<li>Java, JSP, PL/SQL, HTML, JavaScript, XML.

The ESCAPE system is focused on forecasting and planning in support of the computational buy versus repair cycles, analytics for next dollar invested, and stock leveling across the enterprise based upon demand predictions. ESCAPE s software/cloud vendor completed User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in August 2020 and received Service Designated Official (SDO) approval in October 2020 for Full Deployment Decision (FDD) in Q3/Q4 FY21. ESCAPE consists of the following mission area capabilities: Demand Planning, Inventory Planning, Supply Planning, Exception Management, and Performance Management. These core mission area capabilities are based on functional supply chain planning activities and closely align with the actions of supply chain personnel performing the work across the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) (today, these roles are stock controllers, item managers, equipment specialists, operations research analysts, logistics managers and program managers). ESCAPE is based upon Parametric Technology Company s (PTC) Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Service Parts Manager (SPM) software which is an Advanced Planning and Scheduling solution via commercial cloud delivery. The primary deliverable and largest percentage of funding and expenditure on the contract is the licensing fee for the COTS software delivered via the vendor cloud as a fully configured supply end item. The vendor cloud is a turnkey delivery with fully configured environment, associated hardware/software, cloud support, DISA Provisional Authority (PA), and Mission Owner (MO) Authority-to-Operate (ATO). All software, hardware, performance, labor, and IA/cyber compliance risk are borne by the vendor to deliver and sustain the cloud environments availability. The contract also includes sustainment and maintenance of the previously delivered unclassified For Official Use Only (FOUO) National Security System (NSS) Impact Level (IL5) cloud and the acquisition and delivery of a classified (IL6) cloud environment. In addition to delivering the above-mentioned functional capabilities, there will also be a requirement to assist the AF with Organizational Change Management and delivering training materials to prepare the organic supply chain planning community for changes in business practices. To support this vision with the required capabilities, the industry source is expected to provide program management and lifecycle management.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Provide a fully compliant Impact Level (IL) 5 hosting environment and deliver Service Parts Management (SPM) via Software as a Service (SaaS)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Fully compliant means:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Current/approved DISA Provisional Authority</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Current/approved DISA Cloud Access Point (CAP)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Current/Approved Accreditation under the Risk Management Framework</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Current/approved Mission application Authority to Operate</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Integrate with Air Force owned and managed Cloud One or other AF assigned Microsoft Azure hosting environment to interface with ESCAPE&rsquo;s Operational Data Service (ODS) using approved ports</li>\n\t\t<li>Provide multiple environments including production, test, development, training and what-if/simulation</li>\n\t\t<li>Demonstrate knowledge of DISA, DoD, Cloud One, AF CIO, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or various other directives in delivering the cloud environment including acquisition certifications relating to software/hardware/product usage</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Baseline Data Management, Functionality, Capability, and Configuration Support (FDD)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Maintain all current functionality and baseline configuration.

Each MPE operates as its own system. In order to develop and support an evolving product line of&nbsp;Mission Planning components, the Mission Planning program office (HBM) requires critical engineering&nbsp;integration capabilities and explorations into methods to improve architecture design, tools, utilities and security&nbsp;patches/infrastructure to include security monitoring, configuration, and vulnerability management capability.&nbsp;Air Combat Command (ACC) is the lead command for the requirements activities of Mission Planning systems&nbsp;used across various Air Force platforms however, Army and Navy, and other agencies including Foreign&nbsp;Military Sales (FMS) contribute to those requirements in support of their individual missions. AFLCMC/HBM&nbsp;is the lead for the development and delivery of all MP products. Mission Planning products have the potential to&nbsp;support all DoD fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. The Mission Planning user community includes intelligence&nbsp;personnel, aircrew, flight level managers, and force level planners for combat, reconnaissance, airlift, and&nbsp;refueling operations.</p>\n\n<p>Mission Planning involves the creation of a flight plan based on mission needs, threats, targets, terrain, weather,&nbsp;aircraft performance capability, and configuration. It is an essential task that must be completed prior to any&nbsp;fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft sortie. The planner must have the ability to plan the delivery of weapons, cargo,&nbsp;passengers, and/or fuel, as well as calculate fuel requirements and assess the route based on known enemy&nbsp;threat location and type. Mission planners must be able to optimize and de-conflict flight routes with other&nbsp;aircraft; review, print, and brief the mission plan; and load pertinent flight information to on-board aircraft&nbsp;avionics.</p>\n\n<p>The Mission Planning program office (HBM) works collaboratively with the Army and Navy to leverage&nbsp;technical solutions and business practices for all DoD platforms. It provides automated Mission Planning tools&nbsp;and product support for fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft and guided munitions. HBM is replacing two closedarchitecture&nbsp;legacy Mission Planning systems and the PC-based Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS) with&nbsp;a single multi-service open-architecture system more commonly referred to as the Joint Mission Planning&nbsp;System (JMPS). JMPS allows aircrews to process larger amounts of data required for today&rsquo;s platforms more&nbsp;efficiently to be able to create that mission in an acceptable amount of time. Mission Planning delivers&nbsp;significant benefits to command and control (C2) performance by enhancing information superiority for the&nbsp;Warfighters and by providing unique capabilities in support of precision engagement.</p>\n\n<p>The Mission Planning program office operates with a streamlined development process between the&nbsp;Government, Mission Planning Enterprise Contract (MPEC) developers, and the Systems Engineering and&nbsp;Integration Contractor (SEIC). There are currently five (5) MPEC II developers on contract as of February&nbsp;2015: BAE Systems Incorporated, DCS Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman&nbsp;Corporation, and Tapestry Solutions Incorporated.</p>\n\n<p>Mission Planning is framed by the &ldquo;early look&rdquo; approach of all developed software and defined by processes&nbsp;posted on information-sharing platforms such as Mission Planning Central (MPC), a SharePoint site. Early&nbsp;involvement with developers, open meetings and working groups, and open technical reviews allow the&nbsp;Government, MPEC (or other developer) and the third party integrator (SEIC) to effectively find advanced,&nbsp;integrated and Enterprise-wide systems engineering and innovative solutions in the Government&rsquo;s best interest&nbsp;as it pertains to low-risk ways to deliver improved cost, schedule and&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of&nbsp;each Mission Planning&nbsp;Environment (MPE) across the Enterprise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mission Planning development follows a well-defined software factory process which emphasizes a Systems&nbsp;Engineering, software assurance best practices, and integration approach that includes open technical meetings;&nbsp;sharing of code/design/interfaces; unlimited Government rights to products; consideration of advanced IT<br />\ntechnologies, technology insertion collaboration across the Enterprise; early incorporation of development and&nbsp;operation test forces; and submittal of all code and build environments to the SEIC contractor for early&nbsp;evaluation of both source and executable code, all in the context of Enterprise functions. This process has&nbsp;developed over time and does change to incorporate the best available methods, tools and techniques. The&nbsp;process is recorded in the Process Asset Library (PAL) on MPC as well as other Enterprise plans and&nbsp;documents. The contractor shall assist in executing the current software factory process and to recommend&nbsp;improvements to the process as needed. This will include creating a secure code review methodology&nbsp;(leveraging manual, static, and dynamic analysis) as well as acquiring and using code analysis tools.</p>\n\n<p>A key part of the Mission Planning streamlined development process is the Integrated Baseline Approach&nbsp;(IBA), which serves as the basis of what becomes the Mission Planning Environment or JMPS Integrated Build&nbsp;Environment (JIBE). The IBA is a methodology used to allow for the Mission Planning Enterprise to pick the&nbsp;correct version of a component, considering the technology, compatibility, interfaces, and capabilities to&nbsp;support the end user needs. The IBA will consider the testing tools, processes, availability, and data as part of&nbsp;the approach. The software that supports the baseline integration approach is vetted by SEIC for operational&nbsp;effectiveness and suitability with the identified versions of Framework (FW), other components, tools or&nbsp;utilities. The need for the products like the JMPS MPE or JIBE, derived from the IBA, extends beyond MPEC&nbsp;developers: the JIBE enables organic developers and other contracted developers to create the FW, Common&nbsp;Components (CC), and Unique Planning Components (UPCs) that make up the current JMPS architecture. The&nbsp;JIBE is a product offering a solution of compiled JMPS Tools/Utilities/Security Patches and developed software&nbsp;components to expedite the development of MPEs. Currently, the JIBE is tailored to support specific aircraft&nbsp;requirements and vertical integration of the UPC by the developer. The result of a vertically integrated JIBE&nbsp;plus the UPC is a platform-specific MPE, deemed suitable and effective for fielding. The contractor supports&nbsp;integration, verification, validation, and evaluation of all components that make up the MPEs, the remaining&nbsp;sustainment of legacy systems, and the remaining effort to transition from legacy systems to JMPS.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>The program scope includes Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) Architecture Design, Security Patches and&nbsp;Utilities required to field and sustain individual Mission Program Environments (MPEs).

The Systems Engineering and Integration Contractor provides systems&nbsp;engineering products and integrated builds across the Mission Planning Enterprise required to procure and&nbsp;deliver integrated and interoperable MPEs to the US Warfighter(s) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS)&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n<p>Early involvement with developers, open meetings and working groups, and open technical reviews allow the&nbsp;Government, Mission Planning Enterprise Contract (MPEC) developer or other developers and the third party&nbsp;integrator (SEIC) effectively find integrated systems engineering and innovative solutions in the Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;best interest as it pertains to low-risk ways to deliver improved cost, schedule and performance of each Mission&nbsp;Planning Environment (MPE) across the Enterprise. This translates into five main goals of the Mission&nbsp;Planning Enterprise as it pertains to SEIC:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Minimize the overall cost for developing, implementing, and operating Mission Planning Systems acros the Department of Defense (DoD) by way of the System Engineering Integration Contract</li>\n\t<li>Increase the speed of readiness for fielding improvements to Mission Planning Systems to increase&nbsp;operational capabilities (thereby improving Mission Planning Enterprise technical efficiency)</li>\n\t<li>Significantly increase the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resiliency of

fulfilling the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) requirement for Depot Maintenance Consolidated Operational Database Support Services.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Support activity for the DM CODB is located at 4170 Hebble Creek Road, Bldg 280, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5635. The primary purpose of the DM CODB is to consolidate and provide data for the production management of the Depot repair and maintenance process for the Air Force Enterprise. It is an operational-level data environment, serving on-line transaction processing applications for managing day-to-day operations in the Air Force aircraft maintenance depots. As these applications were modernized, technically refreshed, or rehosted, their data was loaded into the DM CODB. This environment then became their common source of data, receives their data updates, and sends and receives their data interfaces. The DM CODB does not absorb any of the primary functional logic of the DMSI application systems, but performs their data retrieval and updates, their interfaces, and scripts needed to produce the interfaces. Through these operational applications, the DM CODB supports AFMC users worldwide, including inventory management specialists, maintenance specialists, equipment specialists, fund monitors, and quality assurance specialists. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DM CODB provides corporate-level data to support AFMC tactical and strategic planning activities. As operational applications are technically refreshed, they are enhanced with new user capabilities for reporting and on-line analytical processing (OLAP). Drawing upon the DM CODB&rsquo;s consolidated data, these systems enable users to extract information, perform analyses, create reports, and respond to information requests from AFMC command-level staff, HQ Air Force staff, and Department of Defense (DoD) elements. The DM CODB also provides data for similar purposes to the Air Force Global Combat Support System Data Services (GCSS-AF DS), and to other data marts / warehouses and Enterprise Integration projects. The DM CODB is based upon and compliant with the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), and the Air Force Global Combat Support System (GCSS-AF) architecture. </p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>(CRITICAL) Experience as the prime contractor, during the past three (3) years, performing software maintenance on applications developed in\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Oracle SQL scripts </li>\r\n        <li>UNIX shell scripts </li>\r\n        <li>Golden Gate </li>\r\n        <li>Perl </li>\r\n        <li>Oracle PL/SQL </li>\r\n        <li>C programming language </li>\r\n        <li>Java </li>\r\n        <li>Extensible Markup Language (XML) </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>(CRITICAL) Personnel having at least three (3) years experience in analysis, development (coding), and testing applications developed using\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Oracle SQL scripts </li>\r\n        <li>UNIX shell scripts </li>\r\n        <li>Golden Gate </li>\r\n        <li>Perl </li>\r\n        <li>Oracle PL/SQL </li>\r\n        <li>C programming language </li>\r\n        <li>Java </li>\r\n        <li>Extensible Markup Language (XML) </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>(CRITICAL) Personnel having at least five (5) years experience performing database administration tasks on the Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) version 10g or higher </li>\r\n    <li>(CRITICAL) Experience as the prime contractor during the past three (3) years, managing and executing tasks for performing computer operations (job monitoring and error handling) on servers running HP UNIX and/or various Microsoft Windows operating systems </li>\r\n    <li>(CRITICAL) Experience as the prime contractor during the past three (3) years, managing, maintaining and executing tasks for performing computer operations (job monitoring and error handling) of approximately 267 batch/interface processes to ensure proper execution of all software processes.

A potential benefit offered to DoD by biotechnology is the ability to secure the supply chain for a wide range of non-medical products via biomanufacturing from domestically sourced feedstocks and reagents, including synthesized DNA. Other possible benefits include reduction in lifecycle costs by utilizing sustainable and self-renewing processes, enhanced or novel product performance, biosecurity, and potential for distributed manufacturing including in austere environments. Defense applications that may be addressed using synthetic biology-enabled manufacturing include but are not limited to small molecules or precursors of small molecules for monomers/pre-polymer/resins/coatings, materials to be used in extreme environments, energetics, electro-magnetic nanomaterials, catalysts (e.g., for fuel cells), structural materials (bio-inorganic hybrid materials), sensors, and living organism products (e.g., for growable biomaterials, bioremediation, bioleaching, probiotics, and sensors). The combination of defense priorities addressable by synthetic biology manufacturing and the commercial potential of these innovations to industry will require the expansion of a relatively small number of experts into an ecosystem and workforce capable of innovating and supplying U.S. defense and commercial requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) is therefore seeking input from industry, academia, nonprofits, and other stakeholders as it considers the establishment of a Manufacturing Innovation Institute (MII) dedicated to synthetic biology (SynBio) for non-biomedical applications. The SynBio MII will seek to enable a wide range of commercial and defense-relevant products and applications that can be customized to continuously evolving DoD and commercial needs. The information provided under this RFI will be used to determine the viability of using a public private partnership business model and to select and scope the technology focus areas. The Department is requesting responses that will assist in refining the technology focus areas currently under consideration (section 5 below), based upon evidence of support for national security requirements, economic benefit, technical opportunity, relevance to industry, sustainability, and workforce development opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the MII network contains 14 Institutes that each have a specific technology or market focus, led by a not-for profit organization that includes domestic-based members from industry and academia. The goal of the SynBio MII would be to create an impactful public-private partnership enabling the advanced development and scale-up of emergent biomanufacturing technologies and processes with the goal of successful transition of existing science and technology into defense and commercial manufacturing applications.</p>\n\n<p>The SynBio MII would be distinct from two other existing MIIs associated with biotechnology: the Department of Commerce (DOC) sponsored National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) and the DoD&rsquo;s Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute: BioFabUSA. NIIMBL&rsquo;s focus is on innovation leading to flexible and agile manufacturing processes for biologic therapies to treat debilitating illnesses. BioFabUSA is focused on establishing large-scale manufacturing of engineered tissues and regenerative medicines. Because both NIIMBL and BioFab USA are focused on products ultimately for human use, the subject matter experts, regulatory environment, methodologies, and toolsets used to produce molecules and materials envisioned in the SynBio MII are substantially different than those employed by them. None-the-less, we anticipate the SynBio MII to interact closely and collaborate with all MIIs, including NIIMBL and BioFabUSA, to seek areas of common interest and reduce or eliminate areas of potential overlap.</p>\n\n<p>The overall goal of the SynBio MII is to reduce the cost and time to achieve robust biomanufacturing with a focus on fostering and sustaining a globally-competitive U.S. manufacturing base. It is anticipated that the SynBio MII will deliver:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Commercializable amounts of target molecules, materials, or cell-based products through scale-up manufacturing and down-stream processing, and</li>\n\t<li>Platforms for testing and evaluation in order to rapidly and thoroughly assess and identify novel functionalities of target molecules, materials or cell-based products</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>The ManTech program invites responders to provide information in support of a potential future solicitation for a SynBio MII. While current MIIs are led by non-profit organizations, MIIs are ultimately industry-driven in order to be sustainable over time and promptly address both commercial and defense needs. Therefore, all responsible sources are encouraged to submit information that shall be considered by the Government.</p>\n\n<p>We ask respondents to align their inputs with one or more of the three following technology focus areas of interest: A. Scale-Up Manufacturing (SUM), B. Down-Stream Processing (DSP), and C. Testing and Evaluation (T&amp;E). Response should address the general questions listed in section 5.D. below as they relate to each technology focus area of interest addressed</p>\n\n<p><strong>A. Focus Area 1: Scale-Up Manufacturing (SUM)</strong> For the SUM topic, the DoD is interested in approaches that facilitate domestic biosynthetic production of molecules (organic molecules, biopolymers, inorganics) and cells. Central to synthetic biotechnologies is the engineering of chassis organisms that are designed to reliably perform an intended function. However, while cellular behavior/yield/growth may be optimized in small-scale systems, engineered organisms often do not behave predictably when introduced into larger scale fermentation systems or other scale-up methods (e.g., via distributed systems or co-location with domestic feedstocks). To increase the use of engineered organisms in manufacturing, the community needs better tools for scale-up manufacturing, including models to relate lab-scale and full-scale fermentation, analytics, and reactors that monitor and adjust growth conditions, metabolites, yield, and other parameters in real time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B. Focus Area 2: Down-Stream Processing (DSP) </strong>DSP refers to post-fermentation characterization, processing and purification of biosynthetic products or cells. In order to advance bio-manufacturing, separation techniques (e.g., tangential flow filtration, distillation, etc.) need to be scalable and commercially-viable. DSP can be performed after small, mediumor large-scale fermentation, and also is essential to confirm that a desired product has been synthesized or cultivated, that it represents a certain fraction of the total products, and that desired purity has been achieved. Novel separation technologies, perhaps borrowed from the chemical engineering and/or materials science communities, may be required. Purification of unique bio-made products (e.g., intact cells) may require development of more tailored, purification tools that are designed for these types of products.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C. Focus Area 3: Testing and Evaluation (T&amp;E) </strong>The ability to rapidly assess and characterize emergent molecules, materials, and cells across a battery of tests and evaluation procedures will be critical, and will also facilitate identification of novel defense applications for biotech-enabled products. The required evaluation platforms present major challenges, in part because of the sheer diversity of new materials, molecules, and cells that will emerge from design-build-test biotechnology platforms. Comprehensive T&amp;E platforms that harness state-ofthe-art analytical tools for characterization, assessments, and measurements of bio-produced molecules, materials, and cells will underpin successful biomanufacturing of these types of products.</p>\n","duration":"FY20 - FY27 (Start 'FY' may vary)","govEntity":{"id":24607,"title":"MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP184583","iqOppId":184583,"oppValue":275038,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541714","title":"Research and Development in Biotechnology (except Nanobiotechnology)","sizeStandard":"1000 Employees"},"primaryRequirement":"Research & Development","procurement":"<p>Bioindustrial Manufacturing And Design Ecosystem was awarded the contract (FA86502125028) on October 20, 2020 for a value of $275,038,545.</p>\n","smartTag":"Products & Services > Primary Tags:Research services, Secondary Tags:Scientific research services, ","smartTagObject":[{"id":"4D14425E-4328-5315-AE11-AA1DD16F2C22","name":"Research services","type":"Services","isPrimary":1},{"id":"1674127B-120A-528E-95C7-A71FF8EEE49E","name":"Scientific research services","type":"Services","isPrimary":0}],"solicitationDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2020-02-24T00:00:00.000"},"solicitationNumber":"FA865020S5028","sourceURL":"https://sam.gov/opp/3d937d84e43c4cda85d1190a8dcb037e/view","status":"Awarded","title":"SPECIFIC SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY MANUFACTURING FOCUS AREAS SUITABLE FOR A MANUFACTURING INNOVATION INSTITUTE (BIOINDUSTRIAL MII)","type":"trackedopp","typeOfAward":"Other","updateDate":"2020-11-06T11:29:10.347"},{"links":{"webHref":{"href":"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/123214"},"contacts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/contacts"},"relatedDocuments":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/relatedDocuments"},"markedByUsers":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/markedByUsers"},"placesOfPerformance":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/placesOfPerformance"},"govEntity":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/govEntities/127891"},"fboNotices":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/fboNotices"},"sourcedFrom":[{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/FBO1080823"}],"relatedArticles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/relatedArticles"},"contractVehicles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/contractVehicles"},"verticals":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/verticals"},"assessment":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/assessment"},"companies":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/companies"},"milestones":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/milestones"},"contracts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP123214/contracts"}},"competitionTypes":[{"id":47,"title":"Undetermined"}],"contractTypes":[{"id":23,"title":"TBD"}],"country":"USA","createdDate":"2015-03-06T00:00:00.000","description":"<p>A vendor is fulfilling the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, 88th Air Base Wing, 88th Air Base Wing Civil Engineer&#39;s&nbsp;requirement for repairing fresh air intake F/10828.</p>\n\n<p><b>REQUIREMENTS:</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The scope of this project includes all work associated with removing existing dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) units, make-up air units, constant volume air-handling units, exhaust fans, and transfer fans, and replacing them with new variable-air-volume (VAV) air-handling units, VAV terminal boxes, exhaust fans, and transfer fans.

Navwar testbeds and constructive mission simulations. Innovative MSW&amp;A tools have been developed to characterize exploratory, advanced, and operational GPS systems in land, air, sea, and space environments. Past RDT&amp;E on-site awards in this area (the most recent being the Navigation Warfare Technology Research Modeling, Simulation, Wargaming &amp; Analysis (MSW&amp;A) (NWTRM) program) have attracted a variety of DoD and industry customers, as the testbeds provide a cost-effective means of effectively predicting and validating Navwar flight test results in a repeatable laboratory environment.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>The objectives of this effort are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Perform Navigation Warfare (Navwar) technology research, including electronic attack (EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic support (ES) techniques for cognitive electronic warfare (EW) applications across air, space, cyberspace, maritime, and land domains.</li>\n\t<li>Perform integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Position, Navigation &amp; Timing Assurance (PNTA), Modernized GPS User Equipment (MGUE) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) research.</li>\n\t<li>Develop and demonstrate algorithms and technology to optimize position, velocity, time, and frequency for airborne platforms at the sensor aperture for collaborative passive radar, Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), and EW techniques and systems.

This includes absolute and relative position, velocity, time and frequency optimization in concert with military GPS receivers and associated EP technologies.</li>\n\t<li>Develop novel simulation technologies and/or enhance existing Navwar test assets for AFRL wargaming activities, Sensor Directorate System Integration Lab (SIL), and cross-Directorate research activities (e.g., RV Space Weather Ionospheric Scintillation and RW/RQ Hypersonic weapons).</li>\n\t<li>Develop a small size, weight, power, and cost (SWAP-C) Navwar testbed for lab, SIL, and flight test/training applications. This innovative testbed capability will enable real-time GNSS processing for Navwar EA, ES, and EP evaluations in live, virtual and constructive (LVC) test environments. The challenge will be to develop a ruggedized and reconfigurable testbed which is reduced at least 50% SWAP-C from the current Fieldable Antenna Wavefront Simulator (AWFS) Next Generation (FANG) Modular Design (FANG-MD). With respect to the software architecture, there will be extensive Graphical User Interface (GUI) development effort, creation of newly developed AWFS antenna models, generation of onboard jamming signals, trajectory generation capability, and standard input/output file structures. With respect to hardware development, the testbed will be much smaller than the current 2-man portable FANG-MD and will incorporate the latest Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology.</li>\n\t<li>The contractor will also conduct exploratory and advanced Navwar research using simulations and experiments in the Assured Position, Navigation and Timing (APNT) Concepts Exploration facility, and provide continued enhancement of the Navwar facility, which hosts the following capabilities (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Navwar Testbed&rdquo;):&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>AWFS</li>\n\t\t<li>Virtual Flight Test (VFT)</li>\n\t\t<li>AWFS Next Generation (ANG)</li>\n\t\t<li>FANG</li>\n\t\t<li>ANG Inertial/GPS Synchronizer (AIGS)</li>\n\t\t<li>Joint Air-to-Surface Strike Missile (JASSM) ANG System Simulator (JASS)</li>\n\t\t<li>Time/Frequency of Arrival (T/FOA) ANG Modification Initiative (TAMI)</li>\n\t\t<li>GPS Interference and Navigation Tool (GIANT)</li>\n\t\t<li>Ionospheric Scintillation Interference System (ISIS)</li>\n\t\t<li>Rotor Blade Modulation (RBM)</li>\n\t\t<li>Hypersonic Navigation (HyNav)</li>\n\t\t<li>Vertical-sensing Effectiveness and CONOPS Tool for Operational Requirements (VECTOR)</li>\n\t\t<li>Multi-ship electronic support hardware-in-the-loop (MESH)</li>\n\t\t<li>FANG-MD</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The contractor shall fabricate or acquire hardware, and write or acquire software and firmware as required to develop a reduced SWAP-C FANG-MD testbed capability usable across the air, space, cyberspace, maritime, and land domains for Navwar EA, ES, and EP applications.</li>\n\t<li>The contractor shall modify, enhance, and maintain the current Navwar Testbed capabilities in the ACE facility to ensure this testbed is capable of supporting layered sensing missions.</li>\n\t<li>The contractor shall perform analyses with the Navwar Testbed on emerging technologies and conduct laboratory demonstrations using systems or simulations which utilize the technologies of interest.</li>\n\t<li>The contractor shall conduct technology and feasibility studies with the Navwar Testbed of exploratory and advanced technologies as a basis for Navwar research.</li>\n\t<li>The contractor shall develop GNSS anti-jam antenna simulation technologies as well as the design and development of prototype hardware for risk reduction and proof-of-concept.
