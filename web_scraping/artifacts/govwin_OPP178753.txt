In addition, senior leaders at all levels required a near real-time snapshot of how operational entities were performing. The solution required a financial data management system capable of scaling initially from a few hundred users to more than 11,000 users around the world. The system had to be operational 24/7 to users and managers in every time zone around the world. System users at all levels needed instant access to information in order to make timely decisions.</p>\n\n<p>CRIS is the data warehouse decision support and analysis solution that meets these Air Force objectives. CRIS is a centralized data repository of U.S. Air Force financial budget and 2 execution, supply, and personnel and payroll data, populated by Government systems. It delivers timely, accurate, and easy to use data while providing superior support to military operations. Users can see daily business financial data anywhere in the world at any time, with some data updated multiple times a day. CRIS operates on a cross-functional data warehouse, including Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), Headquarters Air Force (HAF), command-level and base-level Financial Management (FM), Directorate of Operations (DO), and Directorate of Logistics (LG) reporting functions. Since its inception in 2001, CRIS has grown from an initial limited user base to a current user base of more than 11,000 users performing approximately 1.1 million ad hoc queries each month, with more than 90% of these queries executed in less than 10 seconds. CRIS currently contains approximately 22-plus TB of data, consisting of 90-plus billion rows of data, and database tables 1 billion rows deep.</p>\n\n<p>With CRIS, users can design and submit their own queries, allowing them to retrieve exactly the data that they need to see. Approximately 98% of queries submitted to CRIS are ad hoc queries. In addition to the ad hoc functionality, CRIS also offers customized pre-defined web reports.</p>\n\n<p>The current CRIS capability is built on a scale-out architecture using integrated software products including Microsoft&reg; SQL Server&trade; 2008 R2 Standard Edition, EntelliCache&trade;, and EntelliFusion&trade;. The software components that make up the architecture are loosely coupled allowing for the operating system, Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), and other software patches and upgrades to take place without the need to make changes to CRIS. This architecture provides the ability to be deployed across multiple RDBMS instances. In addition, CRIS offers a service-oriented architecture (SOA) best practice by eliminating the need for point-to-point data links and utilizes web services as a method of server communication. EntelliFusion performs an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) from 15 separate financial systems, verifies the format of the input data files, and then loads the appropriate data according to predefined business rules into the CRIS data warehouse. EntelliCache functions as a query processor that performs ad hoc and standard reports on the financial data stored in the data warehouse. It is tuned to be highly efficient at conducting user queries and delivers reporting results to a web-based front end. (To clarify, a query is defined as a user requesting information and the system reporting the results.)</p>\n\n<p>To ensure data security, CRIS employs a common security model involving the use of roles within the system. Using the Role Server Administrator application, functional program office (SAF/FM AFFSO) personnel can define and apply roles to user accounts that define the data to which the user is granted access. CRIS uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Common Access Card (CAC) to restrict access to the system to authorized users only or other systems having DOD-issued certificates.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Redevelopment of the CRIS architecture</li>\n\t<li>The new CRIS product will need to have development and production environments.&nbsp; These environments will necessitate the purchase of the basic services, database administration, and storage costs through DISA.</li>\n\t<li>Other Software (Ancillary software associated with the system such as cybersecurity/support software as required by policy/regulation)</li>\n\t<li>Provide training to support the developed system. A &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; approach will be the most efficient way of accomplishing this task. Once these trainers are fully up to speed, they can be available to assist in the training the 11, 000 users.</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"Full implementation at least 18-24 months after award (Source: April 2019 J&A)","govEntity":{"id":126278,"title":"BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP178753","iqOppId":178753,"oppValue":15793,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541511","title":"Custom Computer Programming Services","sizeStandard":"$34 million annual receipts"},"primaryRequirement":"Information Technology","procurement":"<p>This Opportunity Report has been updated to include additional task order details.
