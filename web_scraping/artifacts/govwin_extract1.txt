The scope of the DEAMS Program includes administration of the Transportation Working&nbsp;Capital Fund (TWCF) and the USAF General Funds (GF).</p>\n\n<p>DEAMS was approved under Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP) in 2005&nbsp;as a joint United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Defense Finance and&nbsp;Accounting Service (DFAS), and Air Force (AF) project to implement enterprise architecture with&nbsp;commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-based financial accounting software Oracle eBusiness Suite. It will conform to requirements promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget&nbsp;(OMB), Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA),&nbsp;Government Management Reform Act (GMRA), Federal Financial Management Improvement&nbsp;Act (FFMIA), Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA)&nbsp;and other related laws, regulations, and policies.</p>\n\n<p>DEAMS will deliver a single integrated capability for the USAF and USTRANSCOM that provides timely, accurate, reliable, and auditable financial information to enable efficient and&nbsp;effective financial management, accounting, and decision making. DEAMS will provide standardized business rules, processes, and information; an integrated system to process and&nbsp;record budgetary, AF GF accounting, and vendor pay transactions; a system to capture and&nbsp;validate information once and use it across the enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>As of March 1, 2015, DEAMS is deployed to over 40 locations and almost 7,000 users. DEAMS completed Milestone C in February 2015 with Acquisition Decision Document signed on 23&nbsp;February 2015. The Milestone C approved strategy brought forward the requirements of&nbsp;Increment 2 into Increment 1 and delayed the R12 eBusiness Suite technical upgrade until&nbsp;deployments are complete in October 2016 when DEAMS reaches Full Deployment. This&nbsp;significantly increased the FMO activities in FY16 and FY17. DEAMS will deploy to over 140&nbsp;locations and 23,000 users through October 2016. To support these deployments and the R12 upgrade, there will be an increase to the amount of development work and releases planned&nbsp;over the next 2-3 years. During FY16 DEAMS expects to implement Releases 4, 5, 6, and 7&nbsp;into production. DEAMS plans to finalize roll-out to all end-users by 1 October 16. In FY17 DEAMS will complete the technical upgrade of the Oracle eBusiness Suite and will begin&nbsp;development of the capability for US Transcom Surface Deployment and Distribution Command&nbsp;(SDDC).</p>\n\n<p>The existing DEAMS baseline includes Oracle 11i EBS modules listed below. The DEAMS baseline in October 2016 will be a fully configured solution with over 632 reports, interfaces,&nbsp;conversions, extensions, and workflows (RICEW) to meet over 3,000 system requirements. The&nbsp;DEAMS team estimates the existing baseline to represent approximately 94% of the intended&nbsp;solution. The existing design is captured in a System Requirements Document (SRD) with over&nbsp;3,000 requirements. There are anticipated 20,000 plus system users worldwide requiring 24 x 7&nbsp;support to include surges at end-of-month, end-of-year and sustainment software releases. The&nbsp;plan to upgrade to Oracle EBS R12 is anticipated to be completed by 3rd Quarter 2017.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Federal Financials</li>\n\t<li>iProcurement</li>\n\t<li>Accounts Receivable</li>\n\t<li>General Ledger</li>\n\t<li>Accounts Payable</li>\n\t<li>Fixed Assets</li>\n\t<li>Project Costing</li>\n\t<li>Project Billing</li>\n\t<li>Purchasing</li>\n\t<li>Governance Risk &amp; Compliance (GRC)</li>\n\t<li>Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition</li>\n\t<li>User Productivity Kit (UPK)</li>\n\t<li>Service Oriented Architecture Management Pack</li>\n\t<li>User Management Module (UMX)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>This effort is expected to continue and complete&nbsp;DEAMS deployment work required at: (1) the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF); (2) United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE); (3) the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) and (4) the Air Force Material Command (AFMC).</p>\n\n<p>Other Scope/Requirements/Capabilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The scope of this requirement will be to to provide the DEAMS FMO with Contractor personnel that have functional and technical expertise with Oracle Federal Financials eBusiness Suite and associated financial business processes to:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Translate user requirements for input into system specifications, data management plans, configuration management plans, life cycle management documentation, integrated logistics support plans and related operational summaries</li>\n\t\t<li>Gather information from users, define work problems, and design a system and procedures to resolve problems</li>\n\t\t<li>Work with the FMO, the Program Management Office (PMO) and System Integrator(SI)/sustainment contractor on the design, analysis, test of software and logical and physical databases in order to meet functional requirements</li>\n\t\t<li>Provide input to specifications and/or user documentation for client or user personnel</li>\n\t\t<li>Conduct enterprise wide strategic systems planning, business information planning, business and analysis with FMO</li>\n\t\t<li>Assist in developing and implementing policies and procedures relative to the staffing and management of DEAMS capability and functionality and DEAMS accounting capability</li>\n\t\t<li>Provide input into functional, process, and data modeling in support of the planning and analysis efforts</li>\n\t\t<li>Assist DEAMS stakeholders in providing data cleansing and data conversion support</li>\n\t\t<li>Review, develop and update program reports and queries and their associated requirements documentation</li>\n\t\t<li>Examine and analyze current and contemplated operations for developing, defining, and coordinating user requirements to satisfy the total program need</li>\n\t\t<li>Utilize data design, proposed system revisions, and test results to ensure functional requirements are met, to include compliance with Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR), Federal Information System Control Audit Manual (FISCAM)</li>\n\t\t<li>Research, analyze, and provide system technical and functional system specific data to assist the FMO with requests for information</li>\n\t\t<li>Support the FMO and PMO with the review of System Integrator/sustainment contractor&rsquo;s technical proposals to ensure correctness, consistency, completeness, and compliance with requirements</li>\n\t\t<li>Provide support for system deployments for Air Force Space Command and Air Force Materiel Command bases beginning 3rd quarter FY16\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Provide a trained and experienced site lead to interface with the government points of contact at the deployment site to complete pre-deployment checklists and arrange all logistical support beginning 180 days prior to go-live</li>\n\t\t\t<li>The site lead will be continuously onsite for a minimum of 30 days post go-live</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Provide trained and experienced DEAMS SMEs at each location during the DEAMS deployment cycle to provide over-the-shoulder training and support to users\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>The SME will be responsible for providing site-specific training and user assistance.

It provides part number to stock number cross-reference, history of National Stock Number (NSN) changes, and retrieves, stores and updates Bill of Material (BOM) standard data </li>\r\n        <li>E046B - (AFMC Labor Standards Data System (ALSDS)) establishes and maintains labor standards for maintenance planning and production costing. It provides information on data used for capacity planning reports that will evaluate workload and personnel in terms of skills, and a simulation capability in order to determine the impact on skill capabilities and requirements in relation to workload changes </li>\r\n        <li>G004L - (Job Order Production Master System (JOPMS)) provides a repository for storing the production number master records. It also provides the user ability to track customer work requests, record work authorizations, maintain temporary work plans, record end item production, and document standard labor hours earned during depot level maintenance </li>\r\n        <li>G402A - (Exchangeables Production System (EPS)) provides access to workload requirements data, end item availability data, job order number data, production count data, end item production data, on-line information used to manage Depot Maintenance Supply Centers (DMSC) and bench stocks </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Depot Maintenance Legacy Systems (DMLS):\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>D357 &ndash; Reparability Forecast Model (RFM) is a web-enabled analysis tool that utilize information from AFMC logistics data system, Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to project current and/or future parts support. RFM 4 ensures that AFMC Air Logistics Centers (ALCs) provide end item supportability posture by assessing individual Bill of Material (BOM) components. The Special Program Requirements (SPR) application receives the results of the RFM assessment from the database, compares component requirements to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) quarterly demand rate, then calculates the net increase in supply (required to meet projected demand) and presents the data for review and modification by the Material Management Team Leader (MMTL) </li>\r\n        <li>G004C - Depot Maintenance Workload Planning and Control System (DMWPCS) is a legacy batch system which provides the Directorate of Maintenance at each Air Logistics Center (ALC) a method to document and track the results of workload and manpower planning actions for a five year period. Further, it provides a planned and historical labor application, the capability for workload pricing, provides interface data to other data systems, and provides a master listing of all Resource Control Centers (RCC) and their associated accepted workload factors. DMWPCS also provides for a multiple Planned Labor Application (PLA) capability </li>\r\n        <li>G019C - Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) Requirements Scheduling and Analysis System is a legacy batch system which schedules and tracks reparable items and provides Air Logistics Center (ALC) management information necessary to respond to the turnaround times required by the repair cycle. MISTR also produces schedules that are distributed to ALC maintenance organizations for scheduling repair operations by individual stock number and control number </li>\r\n        <li>Quality Information Management Standard System (QIMSS) - is a data system that is used to: collect and compile Quality Assurance (QA) data collected by QA personnel; collect and compile Safety Assessment data collected by Safety Specialists; record deficiencies and observations on AFMC form 343; records corrective action and actions taken to prevent recurrence and records follow-up information </li>\r\n        <li>Information Systems Management Tool (ISMT) is a web-based, GCSS compliant and certified configuration and requirements management tracking and software workload management system. The system supports the entire software life cycle from requirements inception, through deployment. ISMT provides program managers, developers, testers, configuration managers and end users complete visibility into requirement and deficiency <br />\r\n        traceability for both individual programs and roll-up composites of programs. Its dynamic query engine and custom report generator provide numerous options for gathering metrics and the system contains an integrated action tracking capability as well. ISMT is the standard management tool for the AFMC Logistics community and is also used by Air Staff Logistics Portfolio Managers and several other functional area customers. ISMT is a GOTS <br />\r\n        system.

CREATE&rsquo;s overarching goal is to develop and deploy three computational engineering tool sets within applicable acquisition programs to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of those programs. These tool sets involve military aircraft design, military ship design, and radio frequency (RF) antenna design and integration for DoD land, sea, air, and space platforms. This announcement pertains to the RF antenna portion of the CREATE program. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAntennas are an integral part of a weapon system. They perform the critical functions, such as communication, identification, and navigation to increase the effectiveness and survivability of the weapon system. The design of antenna systems is becoming more challenging as antenna systems become more complex in order to counter increasing threats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTopic Areas Include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The CREATE-RF project plans to develop and deploy antenna design and integration tools for DoD acquisition communities supporting all phases of the acquisition cycle. The tools shall have the capabilities to accurately, efficiently, and effectively address the following operational requirements:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Increased operational bandwidth </li>\r\n        <li>More complex materials used in antenna design </li>\r\n        <li>Multi-scale geometry issues (e.g., weapon system platform, antenna circuitry) </li>\r\n        <li>Geometry with moving parts (e.g., soldier movement, structure flexing) </li>\r\n        <li>In-situ antenna performance assessment (e.g., antenna system integration, co-site interference mitigation, EMC/EMI assessment for store integration, high power microwave system power level determination) </li>\r\n        <li>Optimized antenna performance and placement for new and legacy systems </li>\r\n        <li>Structurally integrated antennas </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>The government expects the operational requirements to change over the length of this project. Therefore, the requirements must be updated, validated and vested at the beginning of each development cycle by DoD stakeholders tied to acquisition programs. To address the above operational requirements, the technical scope for this effort shall encompass all aspects of CEM development including, but not limited to&quot;\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Defining real-world test cases, generating validation data, and performing verification and validation </li>\r\n        <li>Developing and implementing geometry modeling tools </li>\r\n        <li>Developing and implementing on multi-node, multi-core high performance computers highly scalable and accurate software incorporating\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>Established CEM techniques (e.g., finite element/boundary integral method, higher order basis function and geometry, surface and volume formulations, wideband prediction technique) </li>\r\n            <li>Fast matrix solver algorithms (e.g., fast multipole method, adaptive cross approximation) </li>\r\n            <li>Developing and implementing a work-flow based robust, easy to use, and productive graphical user interface with extensive knowledge base </li>\r\n            <li>Developing and implementing interfaces to tie geometry, CEM, and graphical user interface to existing government tools (e.g., asymptotic codes) and commercial tools (e.g. circuit modeling tools) to streamline the process and enhance user productivity </li>\r\n            <li>Developing and implementing interfaces to optimization modules&nbsp; </li>\r\n            <li>Developing and implementing maintainable and extensible tools by employing software engineering best practices (e.g. version control, bug tracking, code design documents) </li>\r\n            <li>Transitioning technology to user communities through periodic training and extensive user documentations </li>\r\n            <li>Protecting intellectual property throughout the development, testing, and application stages </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>The government intends to have separate contractors for Tool Evaluation and Tool Development to maintain independency of the evaluation and avoid conflict of interest </li>\r\n    <li>Development network administration\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>The contractor shall administer the Collaborative Development Enclave (CDE) network for the code development and testing. The hardware for the network will be provided by the government. The contractor shall work in conjunction with the AFRL/RYT (DoD-designated software protection office) and the High Performance Computing Modernization Office (HPCMO) to advise CREATE-RF leaders, install software, set-up user accounts, ensure users are able to collaborate, and facilitate sound software engineering practices. The CDE network may include one or more multi-node high performance computers (HPCs) for development and testing. Knowledge of Linux/UNIX environments and multi-processor/multi-core computers is required. The government anticipates a level of effort <br />\r\n        for this task ranging from 1/4 to 1 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) for a single employee </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Geometry modeling tool development\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>The contractor shall design, develop, and improve new and existing computer-aided design (CAD) tools identified by the government as they relate to CEM analysis. In addition, the contractor shall work with other government and contractor geometry code development teams under the CREATE program to address geometry issues <br />\r\n        common to the three CREATE projects. Commonly accepted software development and engineering processes are to be used in these code development efforts. Additionally, no proprietary codes, libraries, packages, data, or documentation shall be used.

The contractor shall implement first principle CEM codes for accurate and efficient prediction of <br />\r\n        complex antenna systems and the antenna&rsquo;s interaction with a platform. The contractor shall employ advanced CEM methods utilizing techniques which best suit the antenna design study. These techniques may include partial differential techniques (finite elements, finite volume, discontinuous Galerkin) and integral equation methods (boundary elements, method of moments, volume integral, Nystrom). Both time and frequency domain methods are of interested. For time domain methods, both implicit and explicit can be utilized &ndash; particularly on meshes which are totally or partially unstructured. For frequency domain, solution techniques such as domain decomposition for sparse matrix systems and solvers such as the fast multipole method (FMM) and adaptive cross approximation (ACA) for dense matrices are of interest. In addition, the contactor shall implement the CEM codes on distributed memory, high performance computers with multiple nodes and multiple cores such that the solution scales efficiently to thousands of processors. It is envisioned that problems of interest will have surface areas in the thousands of square wavelengths leading to unknown counts in the millions. Furthermore, the contractors shall interface the antenna modeling tools with other existing DoD tools (e.g., asymptotic codes, high power microwave simulation codes), commercial tools (e.g., circuitry modeling tools) and optimization modules to enable streamlined prediction process. Commonly accepted software development and engineering processes are to be used in these code development efforts. Additionally, no proprietary codes, libraries, packages, data, or documentation shall be used.

The interface shall be 1) robust for production use; 2) easy to use and include an extensive knowledge base with training cases; and 3) productive to minimize user time and errors in input generation. Commonly accepted software development and engineering processes are to be used in developing the user interface. Additionally, no proprietary codes, libraries, packages, data, or documentation shall be used. The government anticipates an initial level of effort for this task of 1 to 2 employees, each contributing from 1/2 to 3/4 FTE </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Tool transition and training\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>The contractor shall work under the direction of a government leader to develop comprehensive and functional user documentation and training cases.

The initial phase of NBMI will be a virtual institute. Members will collaborate through NBMI to assess materials - technology - manufacturing trade space, establish developmental roadmaps for the community, and address crucial, pervasive hurdles through collaborative projects that utilize their existing facilities. It is anticipated that NBMI may evolve to a physical central facility in the future.</p>\n\n<p>A virtual institute will be financed by the Air Force Research Laboratory. This initiative is anticipated to be funded in part with up to $2.5 million federal contribution, which does not include an anticipated minimum matching cost share from other sources. The goal of the virtual institute is to establish an effective and sustainable framework for the public-private partnership that would include federal agencies, companies and universities, and demonstrate its impact as a risk reduction center that accelerates maturation of the technology and appropriate manufacturing components from a Technology and Manufacturing Readiness Levels of 3 to 6. NBMI&rsquo;s initial focus will be to mature a common, integrated suite of reconfigurable and digitized fabrication technologies that are compatible with biological and nanoparticle materials to transition thin film, mechanically compliant device concepts through a foundry-like manufacturing flow. These robust (flexible and durable) devices and packages, including RF antennas, energy harvesting appliqu&eacute;s, and wireless human performance monitors, are enablers for a vast array of AF capabilities, including ISR, human augmentation, autonomy, and aerospace sustainment through prognostics. Commercially, the integration of these material and manufacturing technologies underpin future point-of-care concepts and ubiquitous computing.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual institute will initially coordinate capabilities and establish cooperative efforts between member institutions toward the common development of openly accessible technologies that provide a successful assessment of innovative device and associated manufacturing capabilities enabling the device thrust.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual institute should maximize engagement of all stakeholders across the supply chain with appropriate agreements. The initial collaborative relationships will provide the virtual institute&rsquo;s competency and infrastructure so as to facilitate the development, integration, evaluation and exploitation of efficient/rapid/flexible manufacturing technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual institute should endeavor to either physically or virtually have access to all relevant manufacturing technologies within its sphere of expertise, including fabrication design tools, processing tools, test and evaluation equipment, and the necessary expertise to maintain these assets.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual institute should be structured to allow for the open exchange of manufacturing information, such as design tools, processing tools, qualification and certification approaches, yield models and fabrication costing methods.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual institute will also contribute to the education, training, and development of the existing and future workforce. It is expected that the NBMI operation model merges the successful facets of existing national and international institutes and collaboration centers, as well as addressing intellectual and data property rights, development and sharing.</p>\n\n<p>The NBMI virtual institute is envisioned to become a self-sustaining entity within 5 years from initiation. Coordination and leadership of the institute may leverage a current or near-established not-for-profit.</p>\n","duration":"See the Other Program Information section of this Opportunity Report","govEntity":{"id":24607,"title":"MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP90026","iqOppId":90026,"oppValue":5590,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541711","title":"Research and Development in Biotechnology","sizeStandard":"1000 Employees"},"primaryRequirement":"Research & Development","procurement":"<p>The Contracting Office stated a Cooperative Agreement was issued on February 8, 2013 to FlexTech Alliance, Inc. for $5.59M.</p>\n","smartTag":"Products & Services > Primary Tags:Research services, Secondary Tags:Scientific research services, ","smartTagObject":[{"id":"4D14425E-4328-5315-AE11-AA1DD16F2C22","name":"Research services","type":"Services","isPrimary":1},{"id":"1674127B-120A-528E-95C7-A71FF8EEE49E","name":"Scientific research services","type":"Services","isPrimary":0}],"solicitationDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2012-10-12T00:00:00.000"},"solicitationNumber":"BAA1301RQKD","sourceURL":"https://sam.gov/opp/1d9a497279c434abac5c9745b477e762/view","status":"Awarded","title":"NANO BIO MANUFACTURING INSTITUTE BAA (NBMI)","type":"trackedopp","typeOfAward":"Other","updateDate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00.000"},{"links":{"webHref":{"href":"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/82981"},"contacts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/contacts"},"relatedDocuments":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/relatedDocuments"},"markedByUsers":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/markedByUsers"},"placesOfPerformance":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/placesOfPerformance"},"govEntity":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/govEntities/129650"},"fboNotices":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/fboNotices"},"sourcedFrom":[{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/FBO629365"}],"relatedArticles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/relatedArticles"},"contractVehicles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/contractVehicles"},"verticals":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/verticals"},"assessment":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/assessment"},"companies":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/companies"},"milestones":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/milestones"},"contracts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP82981/contracts"}},"acronym":"","awardDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2012-12-07T00:00:00.000"},"competitionTypes":[{"id":39,"title":"Small Bus Set-Aside"}],"contractTypes":[{"id":1,"title":"Firm Fixed Price"}],"country":"USA","createdDate":"2012-01-30T00:00:00.000","description":"<strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br />\r\n<p>T Square Logistics Services Corporation is fulfilling the&nbsp;Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), continuing requirement&nbsp;for Fuels Management Services at Wright-Patterson AFB.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Aeronautical Systems Center is the largest of three product centers within Air Force Materiel Command.

The primary PMRT applications are Comprehensive Cost and Requirement (CCaRTM), Data Access Program Reporting (DAPR), Monthly Acquisition Report (MAR), PMRT Enterprise Analytics (PMRT EA), Strategic Management Tool (SMT), Strategic Resource Management (SRM), Resource Identification Tool (RIT), and Acquisition Tracker (Acq Tracker).</p>\n\n<p>CCaRTM is an enterprise program and financial management system that provides organizations with a common sense, hierarchical approach to managing requirements, budgets and execution data. The system allows program and financial managers to define program requirements, formulate budgets, forecast program execution and track execution of funds &ndash; all in one place. In addition to integrating the organization&rsquo;s internal processes, CCaRTM also interfaces with many of the external systems currently used in the AF acquisition process. With CCaRTM, users areseamlessly integrated into official accounting systems, contracting systems and many other external systems. From requirements definition, documentation and coordination, to fully detailed execution forecasting, to funds execution, to the PPBE process, CCaRTM supports the entire life cycle of program and financial management activities in an organization. CCaRTM is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) product and its source code is proprietary. The product is owned by the current PMRT System Integrator (SI).</p>\n\n<p>The DAPR application offers the necessary structure to capture the AF Acquisition Master List (AML), Investment Master List (IML) and Workload Master List (WML) program data in order to provide SAF/AQX a single list of all programs that utilize investment funds. DAPR interfaces with external military Services and OSD applications.</p>\n\n<p>The MAR is a periodic program assessment generated by program offices and submitted to Program Executive Officers (PEOs) for approval and SAF/AQXE for review. The MAR application is a tool used to generate, maintain, review and warehouse program MARs.</p>\n\n<p>PMRT EA supports a full spectrum of business intelligence (BI) use cases, including self-service visualization, guided analytics apps and dashboards, embedded analytics, and reporting, all within a governed framework that offers enterprise scalability. PMRT EA consumes acquisition programmatic data from the MAR and budget/execution information from CCaR to provide users with timely and accurate information. The EA capability utilizes the Qlik Sense Enterprise Analytics platform. Qlik is a COTS product.</p>\n\n<p>The SMT application allows the AF services community to accurately track all their service programs and associated contracts. It is pivotal in streamlining the management and reporting of the services community.</p>\n\n<p>The SRM application is used to manage Risk Based Tiering (RBT), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with the Unit Manning Document (UMD) import and allocation to individual Programs, and Acquisition and Sustainment Unit (ASU) import and review capability. SRM allows strategic insight into the utilization of resources within AFLCMC. The SRM process, through the utilization of SAF/AQ approved Acquisition Sustainment Unit Model Priceouts, allows AFLCMC to analytically define manpower requirements needed to execute all Programs currently tasked to the Center as well as additional programs that will be tasked in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The RIT application is utilized by AFLCMC to identify and track personnel, funding and other resources required to support the Center&rsquo;s Acquisition Programs, Projects and Activities.</p>\n\n<p>The Acq Tracker application provides the Air Force Program Executive Officers (PEO) with visibility into their upcoming acquisitions and contracting actions.</p>\n\n<p>PMRT also employs an Acquisition Data Services Broker (ADSB) capability that enables near real-time federation of acquisition information across the AF acquisition enterprise by brokering data requests via robust, scalable infrastructure. The ADSB serves to integrate acquisition information flowing from authoritative data sources by leveraging batch and/or messaging technologies. It supports publish and subscribe paradigm for specifically-defined data aggregations, whereby subscribers will be notified of new data availability or changes by data&nbsp;publishers. The ADSB capability utilizes Talend for data brokerage management as well as Apigee for application programming interface management. Both are COTS products.</p>\n\n<p>The Common Portal Environment (CPE) will provide role-based user interface, hyperlinks, and mobile access to the various tools/capabilities within PMRT, the Acquisition App Store, and the overall Acquisition Domain. The CPE will provide a consolidated collaboration experience for Acquisition program offices, functional support offices, and senior leaders within the AF and DoD. The CPE will provide a suite of &ldquo;platform services&rdquo; that can be leveraged by any application within the Acquisition Domain, with examples of this being Application Provisioning and Application Monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>PMRT is hosted by Acquisition, Logistics and Technology Enterprise Systems and Services (ALTESS), the Application Modernization Hub for the Army located in Radford, VA. ALTESS manages all aspects of the hosting facility and provides full life cycle support for various DoD information systems. ALTESS provides IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) capability for PMRT and includes RMF cybersecurity services in accordance with DoDI 8510.01 &ldquo;Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT)&rdquo; requirements. This includes compliance with all operational and security guidance published by United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), including applicable Communications Tasking Orders (CTO) and Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The PMRT suite is currently in the process of migrating from ALTESS to the Cloud One. Basic clous sustainment activities and detailed responsibilities: Operating System (OS) and Dependency (e.g. JDK, .Net, etc.) patching and hardening. NGINX Web Server patching and hardening. Maintenance of the third-party software Ansible installation/patching scripts. Infrastructure as code (IaC) script maintenance. Sustain the baseline security/vulnerability scans used to attest to the security of the PMRT Cloud Infrastructure and software for the ATO. Support additional environment, server, container, and application vulnerability scanning as required.

Executing funds through the Defense Production Act Title III Program and the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation, the principal objective of this envisioned government-industry partnership is the construction or retrofit of multiple domestic commercial or pre-commercial scale advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries with the following characteristics: 1) capability to produce ready drop-in replacement advanced biofuels meeting military specifications at a price competitive with petroleum, 2) geographically diverse locations for ready market access, and 3) no significant impact on the supply of agricultural commodities for the production of food.</p>\r\n<p>A robust advanced drop-in biofuels market is an essential element of our national energy security. Energy security for the Nation requires unrestricted, uninterrupted access to affordable energy sources to power our economy and our military. Traditional fossil-fuel based petroleum is derived from crude oil that has increasingly challenging market and supply constraints. Chief among these is limited, unevenly distributed, and concentrated global sources of supply. America&#39;s growing dependence on foreign sources of crude oil undermines foreign policy objectives and comes at an ever increasing impact to the Nation&#39;s trade imbalance. Advanced biomass-derived transportation fuels that use a domestic, renewable feedstock can provide a secure alternative that reduces the risks associated with petroleum dependence.</p>\r\n<p>Given the current economic environment, significant start-up risks, and competitive barriers posed by the firmly established crude oil markets, industry will not assume all of the uncertainty and risk associated with providing a commercially viable production capability for advanced drop-in biofuels. Therefore, it is necessary that the Government take steps to create a strong demand signal and to make targeted investments to achieve the necessary production capacity required for a robust domestic advanced drop-in biofuels industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Title III of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. &sect; 2061 et seq.) grants the President the authority to provide appropriate incentives to develop, maintain, modernize, and expand the productive capacities of domestic sources for critical components, critical technology items, and industrial resources essential for the execution of the national security strategy of the United States.</p>\r\n<p>There are a number of incentive forms available under Title III of the DPA. These include purchases to expand (scale-up) production capacity; improve quality and yield; purchase test quantities for process validation and qualification testing; for development and implementation of business and marketing plans, and to purchase and install production equipment. Purchase commitments that provide a guaranteed market to incentivize companies to establish production capability are also possible.</p>\r\n<p>The DPA itself contains two criteria that every Title III project must meet before any funds may be obligated on a Title III activity. The DPA stipulates that the President must certify to the Congress that the activity satisfies the criteria. The statutory criteria state that: (A) The industrial resource, material, or critical technology item is essential to the national defense; and (B) Without Presidential action under the DPA Title III, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology item in a timely manner.</p>\r\n<p>Two additional screening criteria are also considered by the Title III Program Office in determining the applicability of the use of Title III authorities: (1) Activities under Title III should be the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative for meeting the need. (The problem/issue should be amenable to Title III business solutions. Title III authorities and funding are not intended to be used as supplemental to the normal DoD materiel acquisition or R&amp;D programs); and (2) The combination of U.S. national defense (military) demand and foreseeable non-defense (commercial) demand should be greater than the total domestic industrial capability resulting at the conclusion of the Title III activity. (Title III activities must consider the impact of potentially creating excess capacity. While the projected military demand for a technology or component is the key consideration from a DoD perspective, the projected commercial demand for use in the civilian market can be included to address this issue. Considering whether demand will exceed supply addresses the likelihood that an economically viable industry will result from the Title III activity and that additional financial incentives will not be necessary to maintain the business).</p>\r\n<p>Note that the DPA is concerned with only domestic sources. Foreign capabilities will not be considered. Title III cannot be used to create or expand a foreign source, regardless of the essentiality of the technology to U.S. defense requirements. The DPA defines domestic source to be a business concern that performs in the United States or Canada substantially all of the research and development, engineering, manufacturing, and production activities required of such business concern under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or a critical technology item and that procures from such concerns substantially all of any components and assemblies required under a contract with the United States relating to a critical component or critical technology item. Therefore, with respect to domestic biomass-derived biofuels, feedstocks would be classified as critical components, and as such would also be restricted to domestic sources under a DPA Title III program investment.</p>\r\n<p>Title III is recognized as a set of statutory authorities for addressing industrial base/technology transition issues, not a source of funds. Funding for Title III initiatives may be provided in the President&rsquo;s budget, or by Joint or Service Program Offices of Record, or by Defense Agencies or other Federal Agencies as funding offsets for specific Title III efforts.</p>\r\n<p>The DPA Title III Program Office periodically publishes Title III Requests for Information (RFIs) that provide industry the opportunity to offer insight into the technology transition/ industrial base needs of the specified critical technologies of interest to the government.</p>\r\n<p>The Title III program has identified advanced drop-in hydrocarbon biofuels as a specific technology area of interest for prospective future activity, and interested firms are encouraged to determine if they have information pertaining to this topic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 1: Biofuels must be produced domestically</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 2: Biofuels must comply with EISA Section 526</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 3: Biofuels must come from an acceptable feedstock\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tOfferors who propose to use a &ldquo;transitional feedstock&rdquo; as defined in the FOA must include as part of their Technical Volume a credible &ldquo;transition plan&rdquo; that demonstrates how subsequent commercial production facilities (built after the one built under the DPA Title III Program) could be economically designed, constructed, and operated utilizing &ldquo;renewable biomass&rdquo; materials (as defined in the FOA)</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 4: The biofuels must be drop-in replacement suitable for military operational use</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 5: The proposed Integrated Biofuels Production Enterprise must have a rated capacity of at least 10 million gallons of neat biofuel per year</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 6: The offeror must commit to at least 50% cost share for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 and will provide Contingency Reserves during Phase 2 equal to at least 25% of total Phase 2 costs</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tRequirement 7: The proposal must contain completed information inputs in accordance with prescribed formats for each of the following FOA attachments</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPhase 1: Planning and Preliminary Design\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tParticipate in and support a third-party validation of demonstration-scale technical data by an independent engineer (hired by the Government)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tComplete and submit to the Government a front-end loaded (also known as a Schedule A) design package of the commercial-scale IBPE</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tIdentify and secure project site</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tComplete and submit to the Government a Phase 2 Proposal that will include\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated Comprehensive Business Plan&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdated Technical Volume with Master Implementation Plan and Master Schedule&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPhase 2 Cost Volume&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport the Government in conducting and documenting an Initial Manufacturing Readiness Assessment &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConduct project management, administration, and reporting</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tPhase 2: Construction, Commissioning and Performance Testing\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tComplete a detailed design engineering package to enable the awardee to build (or modify) and equip a fully functional IBPE</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tFinalize site permitting requirements</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tInstall, commission, and qualify IBPE facility equipment.

Each lab has a unique test and evaluation mission.</p>\n\n<p>Aircrew Oxygen System Performance Test and Evaluation. The Life Support Systems Scientific Test, Analysis, and Qualification Lab (LSS-STAQ) is a critical part of the Air Force&rsquo;s contribution to National Defense. Airmen often operate in extreme environments under extreme conditions with the accompanying extreme physiological stressors in high-altitude operations necessitating oxygen and breathing support systems (e.g., oxygen systems, masks, and breathing regulators). These stressors not only pose obvious biological and physiological safety risks, but also have strong implications for operator cognition and performance.</p>\n\n<p>Further, next generation aircraft and associated Warfighter technologies present additional physiological risks and threats for the aircrew due to their higher cabin altitudes and complex G environments. New and improved On-Board Oxygen Generating Systems (OBOGS), related oxygen systems, and life support technologies are needed to facilitate combat readiness and ensure Warfighter safety. These newer aircrew life support and performance technologies pose serious challenges to maintaining an acceptable level of safety and performance for the expanded aircrew population. New and improved protection and life support technologies, safety devices and personal protective gear, and advanced computational modeling capabilities are needed to facilitate combat readiness and ensure Warfighter safety.</p>\n\n<p>Airmen Accommodation Laboratory Testing and Evaluations. The Human Systems Division (HSD) relies on the Airmen Accommodation Laboratory (AAL) to measure and represent the USAF airmen body size data as it relates to fit, function, and safety, as the AAL places great importance in improving protection for our Warfighter. The high-tech science behind fit is anthropometry, the study of human body measurements. For equipment and aircraft acquisition programs, there is a requirement to collect traditional anthropometric measurements, demographic information, and three-dimensional (3D) data for body shape information on current USAF personnel. These data are used to quantify the performance of crew station and protective equipment design as they relate to verification of fit. Furthermore, the level of accommodation, or percentage of the population accommodated, is quantified and used to develop tariffs for equipment items. For crew stations, the complex multivariate body size proportions must be evaluated to estimate physical accommodation limits based on functional/operational/mission requirements for new airframes, and airframe modifications.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it is necessary to identify changes in the U.S. recruitment population and chronological trends in body dimensions in order to accurately represent current and future USAF male and female populations.

An associate contract agreement with the network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of DMO integration.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The F-15C and F-15E MTC Systems will be a high-fidelity immersive simulation system that facilitates F-15C and F-15E personnel training in simulators</li>\n\t<li>The F-15C and F-15E MTCs will be an integrated set of hardware and software that will implement the performance requirements\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Cockpits\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>The simulator system cockpits must be a high-fidelity representation of the F-15C aircraft, including controls, displays, avionics, and aerodynamic flight modeling representative of the F-15C aircraft. The system shall provide realistic simulation of F-15C handling characteristics for all normal ground and flight regimes. The system must be equipped with a full field-of-view visual display, digital image generation system for visual, night vision imaging system, joint helmet mounted cueing system (JHMCS), and radar data base. The four cockpits will be designed for networked training scenarios of one or more participants and in addition allow for stand-alone, solo pilot training. Cockpit hardware and software will be modular and an open architecture design to allow for flexibility for upgrades and incorporation of new hardware/ software technology.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Synthetic Environment\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>The simulator will create a realistic, high fidelity environment capable of supporting a full range of mission scenarios. It will support a mix of constructive and interactive entities that react to aircraft flight maneuvers, avionics, weapons systems, and atmospheric conditions. It will accurately model physical, electronic, and aerodynamic capabilities of real world threats. It will also accurately model and integrate the impact of aircraft countermeasures (i.e., chaff, flares, jamming, anti-radar maneuvers, etc.). It will realistically model electronic combat entities and their effects. Constructive entities will include blue, gray, and red air entities as well as ground based threats. Threats will operate under a realistic, dynamic command and control structure. The system will provide aerodynamic and visual simulation of aircraft battle damage.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Instructor Operator Station (IOS)\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>The IOS will provide the instructor the ability to monitor the simulation, all displays, and instrument indications of each cockpit independently or all four interconnected cockpits. The system will also provide the capability to set up and run one or more independent simultaneous missions. It will also include the ability to simultaneously operate local and long-haul network devices and monitor all missions. This system must be capable of managing a DMO mission environment. The IOS will be capable of controlling and inputting threats, emergency procedures (EPs), instrument indications, and weapons hit/miss data. The IOS must provide means for generation, setup, monitoring, and evaluating simulated training scenarios and missions. These scenarios can be changed or modified by the instructors at any time during the mission via the IOS. The capability to share scenarios and missions between networked sites must be provided. The IOS will give the instructor the capability to insert specific or dynamically created situations into the simulation. This includes EPs, threats, instrument indications, weapon hit/miss data, and other mission events. The IOS will be capable of freezing/resetting individual or all four cockpits scenarios independently. The IOS must be capable of restarting at the point of freeze, start of mission, or at a dynamic instructor-selected point in the mission. The IOS must also be able to set mark points and repeatedly reset to those points. The IOS needs to allow generation of additional scenarios of varying classification levels concurrently with flying a scenario.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Networking\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>The MTC must provide local area and wide area network capability and use the most current long-haul networking protocols. The systems will be capable of connecting to and being a full participant in the DMO environment for one, two, or more trainers and will be required to meet the CAF DMO standards</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Briefing/Debriefing Facilities\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide a &ldquo;God&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; view, selected own-ship or target views, and full battlefield observation (observation of the entire scenario, or a selectable major portion thereof). The system should include the ability to independently observe displays of an own-ship or a combination of selected displays from the four interconnected cockpits. The system must have the capability to record full mission data for replay. Brief, real-time observation, and debrief capabilities of this system must support all four own-ships simultaneously. The recordings should be both achievable on removable media and transferable to other sites over the network. Minimum recording time length of 120 minutes will be supported (a longer recording time is highly desired). The current brief/debrief system represents an example of the required capability. The brief/debrief capability should be able to provide &ldquo;before the mission&rdquo; planning or briefing mode, &ldquo;after the mission&rdquo; debrief capability, and &ldquo;real time&rdquo; observation capability to watch the mission as it unfolds. The before/after mission period modes require a video teleconferencing capability for all participating crews, at the appropriate classification levels.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>F-15C and F-15E MTCs must be maintained in fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"6 year(s) base","govEntity":{"id":127885,"title":"AGILE COMBAT SUPPORT DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP184748","iqOppId":184748,"oppValue":229477,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541990","title":"All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services","sizeStandard":"$19.5 million annual receipts"},"primaryRequirement":"Engineering, Scientific and Technical Services","procurement":"<p>A sole source contract (FA862121C0001) was awarded on June 28, 2021 to The Boeing Co.</p>\n","smartTag":"Products & Services > Primary Tags:Training services, ","smartTagObject":[{"id":"D091E243-9FB8-4300-A497-EF5B505FBE7D","name":"Training services","type":"Services","isPrimary":1},{"id":"D317A456-B7A1-5240-9727-9ECF9135B455","name":"Offices","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0},{"id":"977B8A0B-E245-54E5-AF89-B7E73734F4FF","name":"Residential facilities","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0},{"id":"BF887EA4-828F-549A-A061-E6B69FEDAC2F","name":"Training facilities","type":"Structure","isPrimary":0}],"solicitationNumber":"CombinedF15CEMTCSourcesSought","sourceURL":"https://sam.gov/opp/06de2f0d030467403b57443bef821ed5/view","status":"Awarded","title":"COMBINED F15C AND F15E MISSION TRAINING CENTER SERVICES (MTC)","type":"trackedopp","typeOfAward":"Undetermined","updateDate":"2021-09-29T12:44:41.010"},{"links":{"webHref":{"href":"https://iq.govwin.com/neo/opportunity/view/58320"},"contacts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/contacts"},"relatedDocuments":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/relatedDocuments"},"markedByUsers":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/markedByUsers"},"placesOfPerformance":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/placesOfPerformance"},"govEntity":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/govEntities/129650"},"fboNotices":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/fboNotices"},"sourcedFrom":[{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/FBO824379"}],"relatedArticles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/relatedArticles"},"contractVehicles":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/contractVehicles"},"verticals":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/verticals"},"assessment":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/assessment"},"companies":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/companies"},"milestones":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/milestones"},"contracts":{"href":"https://services.govwin.com/neo-ws/opportunities/OPP58320/contracts"}},"acronym":"","awardDate":{"deltekEstimate":"false","govtEstimate":"false","value":"2011-07-12T00:00:00.000"},"competitionTypes":[{"id":39,"title":"Small Bus Set-Aside"}],"contractTypes":[{"id":1,"title":"Firm Fixed Price"}],"country":"USA","createdDate":"2009-09-03T00:00:00.000","description":"<strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br />\r\n<p>Shiloh Services, Inc. is currently fulfilling the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC),&nbsp;requirement for Fuels Management Services at Wright-Patterson AFB. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, Aeronautical Systems Center is the largest of three product centers within Air Force Materiel Command.

Current approaches often prevent small manufacturers from quickly identifying manufacturing requirements that match their unique competency and providing bids at a reasonable cost. Existing systems simply post the Government&rsquo;s requirements without screening or organizing the requirements based upon the forecasted capabilities needed to meet them. This approach often leaves small business combing through a mass of spare part requirements until they find an opportunity that can be filled by their set of capabilities and expertise. </p>\r\n<p>In order to address current issues associated with acquiring critical spare parts for military systems and improve participation of small manufacturers in building components for the military, the DoD is seeking E-sourcing solutions that screen, organize and present Government spare part requirements to the industrial base thereby improving the ability to pair the right suppliers with the right parts at the right time. Web-based supplier &ldquo;portals&rdquo; such as FedBizOpps.gov provide varying capabilities for sourcing manufactured goods from the industrial base. However, there is no national-level, integrated framework to enable rapid, high-density, multi-sector brokering between buyers and US suppliers. Numerous inchoate examples exist in the US as a result of sector-wide efforts (e.g. supplier exchanges), but technical, procedural, and cultural barriers exist which limit the full potential of such portals to open opportunities for more US manufacturing business. The DoD seeks to explore the potential of an advanced &ldquo;electronic marketplace&rdquo; to improve industrial base response to critical warfighter needs. </p>\r\n<p>Potential portal-based solutions must serve as an interface between existing Government systems and the industrial base. They should organize industrial base participants based upon their manufacturing capabilities and provide matched opportunities to the most relevant pools of suppliers. It is the intent of DoD to select, mature and implement an electronic marketplace (&ldquo;sourcing portal&rdquo;) that will enhance the industrial base&rsquo;s ability to access and bid on relevant business opportunities while addressing a diminishing DoD supply-base, high lead times for parts acquisitions and higher than needed lifecycle costs. </p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Define, design and deploy a capability which:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Develops and pilots tools and practices which cause a greater number of US companies to bid on DoD business </li>\r\n        <li>Improves the capability of US manufacturers to participate and thrive in a digital enterprise </li>\r\n        <li>Develops advanced capabilities for identifying manufacturers (&ldquo;sourcing&rdquo;) and matching capability and capacity to needs </li>\r\n        <li>Becomes self-sustaining, with potential to scale-up beyond DoD markets and significantly expand national and global access to (and demand for) US manufacturing capacity </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Contractors will either:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Develop a new or enhance an existing web portal or online exchange to provide a better sourcing capability for DoD needs for manufactured products </li>\r\n        <li>Enable DoD buyers to reach a broader range of potential suppliers through more sophisticated sourcing tools </li>\r\n        <li>Provoke non-traditional DoD manufacturers to seek DoD-related business by reducing or eliminating current business and technical barriers </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>During this pilot effort, the DoD will post RFQs for needed parts, components, assemblies or products via the portal capability </li>\r\n    <li>Those needed items may come from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or from units within the services </li>\r\n    <li>Initial parts will be metallic and require typical metal manufacturing processes, such as casting, forging, milling, grinding, etc </li>\r\n    <li>The key success criteria for this effort are the following:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Increase in the number of new sellers that have not previously worked with the DoD </li>\r\n        <li>Increase in the average number of responses per RFQ </li>\r\n        <li>Decrease in item cost </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>The desired characteristics of this portal capability include the following:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>The portal shall provide a secure infrastructure with tools that have proven to be valuable for sourcing complex manufactured goods\r\n        <ul>\r\n            <li>This capability should be able to clearly demonstrate how those tools facilitate sourcing, particularly allowing buyers to efficiently find the greatest number of manufacturers with the right capabilities and capacities at the right time;

Advances made in the program are expected to lead to improved nanomaterials, material processes, and devices for digital, radiofrequency, microwave, an infrared detector, optoelectronic, secure communication, power generation, sensing and control applications. The range of materials to be investigated in this program includes semiconductor materials, magnetic materials, optical and electro-optical materials, dielectric materials and their heterostructures. Also, studies of lifetime and failure physics may be needed to understand said devices and materials.</li>\n\t<li>The Research and Development will also include the design, synthesis, material growth, device fabrication/processing, and evaluation of new and/or modified material systems and new/improved laboratory test procedures, analytical, characterization, and modeling techniques to evaluate materials and device performance. These will affect such technical challenges as frequency-agile operation over the broad electromagnetic spectrum, improved detection of day/night events with higher resolution or larger coverage area, higher operating temperature sensors with low noise, higher power density in electronic materials use, minimization of energy consumption, size, and weight of electronic devices, conformal, flexible, and shock-resistant electronic materials, affordable electronic material processes, and electronic material reliability. The goal is the development of nanoscale materials and processing methodologies that are vital to creating advanced materials and devices for future Air Force (AF) systems.</li>\n\t<li>This program encompasses research and development work on a broad range of electromagnetic materials. The materials may be synthesized/grown, characterized, analyzed, fabricated, or theoretically studied. Examples of such materials include but are not limited to the following: dielectric materials, magnetic, nanomaterials, quantum materials.</li>\n\t<li>SPECIFIC PROGRAM OBJECTIVES\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Modeling and Theory. This effort focuses on developing theoretical models and computational tools to guide experimental work of materials used in magnetic, electronic, optoelectronic, and optical applications. These models may cover a broad range of physical lengths from an atomistic level to a macro device level. Potential areas to consider but not limited to would be density functional theory, molecular dynamic theory, and finite element analysis, which could be used as building blocks for integrated computational materials science and engineering (ICMSE) approaches in material research.</li>\n\t\t<li>Material Synthesis/Growth. The development of research materials will need the use of various physical vapor and chemical vapor deposition processes to grow thin films of desired magnetic, electronic, optoelectronic, and optical nature. Examples of such systems are pulsed laser deposition (PLD), sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), atomic layer deposition (ALD), molecular layer deposition (MLD), or other vacuum-based systems as needed. Also, synthesis of materials may be done in a beaker mixing various chemicals in solution at room temperature or at high temperatures (&gt;1000<sup>o</sup> C) where a melt is required. Such equipment may need modifications or supplies to complete the task.</li>\n\t\t<li>Fabrication/Processing. This effort involves the fabrication of materials into various shapes and sizes and creating areas that are conducting (like metals), semiconducting (like dichalcogenides) or insulating (like oxides, nitrides). In order to do this various techniques will be needed but not limited to the focused ion beam, ultraviolet lithography, nanolithography, e-beam lithography, reactive ion etching, wet chemical treatment involving acids, and solvents, metal evaporation/sputtering, ion implantation, and mechanical and electronic fixture arrangements. Such equipment may need modifications or supplies to complete the task.</li>\n\t\t<li>Characterization/Testing. Many types of characterization and testing procedures are needed to study both material quality and device operation. In general, these can fall into magnetic, electronic, optical, and thermal testing techniques, combined with mechanical loading in some test scenarios. These techniques can encompass the areas of microscopy, spectroscopy, transport, and radiation. Here is a listing that is not limited to: atomic, electric, piezoelectric, and magnetic force microscopy; scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, infra-red, thermal atomic force microscopy; secondary ion mass spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, impedance and dielectric spectroscopy, scanning tunneling probe spectroscopy, magnetic field measurements like Hall Effect, resonance; optical absorption and emission, photoluminescence; time-domain thermoreflectance; spin and electron currents; x-ray diffraction; micron-scale in-situ measurement; development of new characterization and testing techniques.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Nanoscale electronic materials and processing.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>To explore, develop, and mature understanding of nanoscale&nbsp;electrical and thermal transport to develop improved materials and processes that can potentially impact the electronic and electro-optic Air Force applications including high-frequency RF transistors, frequency-agile RF devices, high bandwidth transmit/receive elements, improved A/D converters for electronic warfare, and improved thermal management of electronic and electro-optic devices. Specifically, plan to demonstrate the controlled synthesis and growth of nanomaterials, characterize the material, fabricate, and characterize test device structures, which can provide on-off ratios of &gt;1x10<sup>6</sup>, mobility &gt;100 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, device reliability up to 90%,&nbsp;synthesis &lt; 300<sup>o</sup> C, and material supporting &gt; 1GHz operation.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Advanced research on quantum materials &amp; processes.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>To conduct research and development in the area of materials and processes for emerging new materials based on quantum confinement of electrical carriers (electrons and holes) in nanostructured materials. These nanostructured materials may consist of III-V and II-VI semiconductors, diamond and silicon carbide nanocrystals, graphene, and multiferroic oxides. These nanostructured materials may be in the form of superlattices, quantum dots, ultrathin films (&lt;20&Aring;) or layered heterostructures to achieve new electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. These materials are inorganic semiconductors, and therefore require a fundamental knowledge of both solid-state physics and quantum mechanics. The overall goal is to discover new materials and improved processes for future electronic, magnetic, and optical devices for Air Force applications. The potential AF applications relevant to the materials research in this effort are in the areas of infrared detection, tunable radar and communication devices, spintronics, and quantum encryption/information devices.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n","duration":"60 month(s) base","govEntity":{"id":24607,"title":"MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING DIRECTORATE"},"id":"OPP123230","iqOppId":123230,"oppValue":42000,"primaryNAICS":{"id":"541712","title":"Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)","sizeStandard":"1000 Employees except 1500 Employees for Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts and 1250 Employees for Other Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Guided Missiles and Space Vehicles, their Propulsion Units, their Propulsion Units and Propu"},"primaryRequirement":"Research & Development","procurement":"<p>Through a Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA), Deltek received a copy of contract FA865016D5408.

Rapid Prototyping typically utilizes advanced layer manufacturing technologies that can quickly generate complex three-dimensional objects directly from computer-based models devised by Computer Aided Design (CAD). This computer representation is sliced into two-dimensional layers, whose descriptions are sent to the fabrication equipment to build the part layer by layer. Rapid prototyping includes many different fabrication technologies. Stereolithography (SL), selective laser sintering (SLS), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), and fused deposition modeling (FDM) are a few examples. These Rapid Prototyping processes have already had the effect of both improving products and reducing their development time. Rapid Manufacturing is an attempt to transition these prototyping techniques to the manufacturing floor. This form of manufacturing can be incredibly cost-effective and the process is far more flexible than conventional manufacturing. Rapid Prototyping processes have been shown to be economically feasible for use in the manufacture of non structural parts in quantities. This Rapid Manufacturing effort will focus on the use of these Rapid Prototyping processes in the fabrication and/or assembly of Aerospace Structures </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>White papers are therefore being sought that address:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Identification and demonstration of the use of rapid manufacturing in the fabrication and/or assembly of aerospace structures.

Federal is currently fulfilling the Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Electronic System Center (ESC), 554 ELSG/PK, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, requirement for Subject Matter Expert (SME) support for the Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) and Stock Control System (SCS). </p>\r\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>\r\n<p>AFEMS <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) is designed to provide the United States Air Force with a worldwide accessible, dedicated, totally integrated, transaction-driven, processing system that enables accountability and management of approximately $38B worth of equipment resources. AFEMS is used by Air Force (AF) Equipment Managers world-wide to determine, authorize, account for, provide visibility to, and report the types and quantities of equipment required to accomplish the AF mission, and serves as a primary basis for organizational budget/buy programs. AFEMS processes all AF data for management of equipment, information technology and wireless assets, Special Tooling/Special Test Equipment (ST/STE), and Internal Use Software (IUS) via online web enabled interactive processes. AFEMS provides the AF a centralized equipment requirements system utilized to identify, prioritize and fund equipment buys and formulate equipment budgets. AFEMS is Chief Financial Officer (CFO) compliant and enables capitalization of equipment, Information Technology (IT), ST/STE assets, and IUS meeting the capital threshold to ensure the Plant, Property &amp; Equipment (PP&amp;E) portion of the AF Financial Statement is auditable. AFEMS consists of the following subsystems; Support Equipment (SE) unclassified, SE classified, Asset Information Management (AIM), Equipment Management System (ERS), electronic Access Request Management System (eARMS), and Capital Reporting for CFO requirements. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom a topology standpoint AFEMS runs on two mainframes (unclassified and classified) and sixty plus servers. AFEMS has been partially migrated from the mainframe environment to an n-tier architecture which emulates the GCSS-AF Integration Framework (IF). It is hosted at Wright Patterson AFB on the Air Force network. Operations, maintenance and sustainment support is provided by the sustainment contractor and the Program Management Office (PMO). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough AFEMS first went into production as a mainframe application in 1996, it has in the last few years undergone changes to make it web accessible. In FY02 upgrade efforts began to migrate AFEMS functionality to support Global Combat Support System (GCSS) AF Integration Framework (IF) architecture. This involved the use of a spiral development methodology in conjunction with the Rational Unified Process (RUP) to transition legacy code to a GCSS-AF compatible componentized system residing on an n-tier based architecture. This configuration was to provide the means to meet the GCSS-AF mandate for seamlessly integrating all combat support automated information systems into an information-on-demand web-based architecture. Business components were identified, and were in various stages of technology refresh when the December 2003 decision was made to stop technical refresh efforts in AFEMS and redirect enhancement and &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; sustainment funding to the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) program. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe functional operation of AFEMS is governed by Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.64 - Accountability and Management of DoD-Owned Equipment and Other Accountable Property; DFAS 7900.4.G - A Guide to Federal Requirements for Financial Management Systems (Chapters 3 &amp; 14); DoD Financial Management Regulation (Vol 4, Chap. 6); Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, Volume Two, Part 2, various chapters; AFMCMAN 23-4 Computation of Requirements for Equipment Items, in addition to other guidance. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSCS <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSCS is a web-based mainframe wholesale and depot retail asset management system used worldwide by the United States Air Force and United States Marine Corps (USMC). It provides enhanced processing of stock control transactions and management information for Air Force and USMC operations. The system directly supports HQ AFMC, the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), USMC, and other Services/Agencies and foreign military sales customers. SCS is a combination of web-based and legacy mainframe architectures, which provides worldwide asset visibility, real-time requisition processing, management control activity for contractor requisitions, and depot supply management. It provides worldwide combat readiness and sustainability for the war fighter through allocation, custody, and distribution of Air Force and USMC managed supply and equipment items. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSCS consists of the following modules/functionalities: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Item Manager Wholesale Requisition Process (IMWRP) </li>\r\n    <li>Wholesale Management and Efficiency Report (WMER) </li>\r\n    <li>Reportable Asset Management Process (RAMP) </li>\r\n    <li>Special Support Stock Control (SSSC) </li>\r\n    <li>Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) </li>\r\n    <li>Reutilization and Disposition System (RDS) </li>\r\n    <li>Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping (WARRS) </li>\r\n    <li>Inventory and Storage Process (INSTOR) </li>\r\n    <li>Shipping Information System (SIS) </li>\r\n    <li>Marine Corps Interface Process (MCIP) </li>\r\n    <li>SCS Web Inquiry </li>\r\n    <li>SCS Web Requisitioning </li>\r\n    <li>Financial Inventory and Accounting Billing System (FIABS) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>SCS is in sustainment status and will be replaced by the Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, is one of the documents that govern the processes of SCS. </p>\r\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>HQ 754th ELSG/ILSA requires functional and technical SMEs for AFEMS, SCS, and ECSS as it relates to these two systems.
